""you go to college and get a good education or you might end up begging on the street."" i've had conversations in therapy about this. the actual financial planning aspect of this wasn't covered very well aside from teaching me how to balance a checkbook, a skill that i no longer remember or need.what was your first job and why did you get it?i got a job as a lifeguard when i was 15. it was at a summer camp i worked at before as an unpaid intern. i just thought it was fun to work there and even better when i got paid. i then got a job in sales at a shoe store in the mall when i was 16 and haven't been unemployed a day since. i wanted to move out at age 18 and started working towards that. i also didn't think that my family had much money (see below) and wanted to be able to have spending money.did you worry about money growing up?yes and no. my father was extremely frugal and this led me to believe that we didn't have much money, but i never worried about it too much because we never went without necessities. we just didn't get to do some things we wanted, like dance lessons. as an adult, i realize that this is because my grandparents grew up during the great depression and my father graduated college in the 80s with a finance degree that he was never able to get a job with. he's worked at the post office doing machine maintenance my entire life. i now realize that supporting a stay-at-home mom and two kids, while owning a house and three vehicles outright and being able to afford vacations was fairly well off. this was a result of my father's frugality, which i appreciate much more now.do you worry about money now?not really. i worried about the possibility of losing our jobs at the beginning of the pandemic, but i think my husband and i are both well-established enough in our fields to be re-employed pretty quickly. i know that we are blessed in that both of our families would be able to come through if we ever had to ask for help.at what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?i moved out at age 19 and became mostly financially responsible at that point other than being on my dad's health insurance and phone plan until age 26. i paid him for my phone and a portion of the monthly bill, it was just cheaper that way. our financial safety net would be our families if needed, but of course, as a last option.do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? if yes, please explain.yes. other than the tuition plan, i didn't know any of this was coming to me until my parents divorced when i was 17 and my dad told me about it. my sister and i each had an investment account set up by my dad with my grandmother's money. it was intended to make profit and go to her if she needed it while she was alive or to us if she never needed it. she did not need it and i had $15,000 that i lived off of while i was in college. i worked part-time at a restaurant then, but it wasn't enough to cover my bills. when my grandmother passed, i inherited another $35,000 (at age 21) that i put into the same investment account. most of that money (minus grad school payments here and there and $1,000 for a broken tooth) stayed there until we made a $20,000 down payment last year when buying our house. i've had a lot of guilt about the privilege of this money that i didn't earn and how i stay weirdly quiet when my friends are commiserating about student loans. i also got $5,000 from my dad as a wedding gift at age 23 and some of that money also went to my grad school.day one7:30 a.m. — good morning world! feed my pups and have my usual breakfast: a cup of coffee and yogurt with probiotic powder mixed in, along with birth control, zoloft for anxiety, and a gummy vitamin. i sit outside with my coffee while reading news articles.8:30 a.m. — wfh time! log on and go through my e-mails. i am a counselor on a research study at a hospital. my job is a dream job and it sometimes still amazes me that i landed it so quickly.12 p.m. — eat lunch while doing documentation. weekday lunches are always a quick amy's frozen meal or soup and grilled cheese (really enjoying being able to make a stovetop grilled cheese during wfh)! 2:30 p.m. — i usually eat while i'm working so that i can take a lunch break nap, which is my absolute favorite thing about wfh. fall asleep to rain sounds on the google home. wake up 30ish minutes later with an alarm (who knows what i might sleep through otherwise). make another cup of coffee. daily afternoon coffee is a (probably bad) habit that started in college when i'd be in class all day and then have to study and it has stuck with me. 4 p.m. — snack on a couple of kiwis and dark chocolate almonds while i'm doing documentation from more appointments. after work, i do 30ish minutes of youtube cardio (jessica smith's channel) and 15 minutes of yoga for hips (cole chance yoga). yoga is my main love in terms of exercise but i've increased my cardio lately. my husband, y., got a haircut today. his haircuts cost more than mine, but i figure it balances out since i also get pedicures! $768 p.m. — i eat leftovers for dinner and chat with t. i'm hit in the feels when he tells me that he has a reminder on his phone that goes off every month on this day to reach out and check on loved ones. one of our friends died by suicide on this day of the month a few months back and being reminded of this and how it's impacted us is a gut punch sometimes. worn out and in bed around 11:30.daily total: $76  day two 8:30 a.m. — in the words of rihanna, work work work work work work! i've had my coffee and it's go time. 12:30 p.m. — take a lunch break after completing some appointments with patients. we've had some issues with ants in the house recently and have an appointment with an exterminator to do their thing during my lunch break. $86.553 p.m. — have been catching up on documentation from my earlier appointments. do a check-in call with a patient who's been struggling with depression. he is outside enjoying the weather and reports feeling much better than he has lately. always happy for good news on my patients! take my laptop outside to enjoy the weather myself and keep working with an iced coffee and some chocolate almonds.5 p.m. — hop on the exercise bike for half an hour. i stalked next door last year when all the exercise equipment was sold out and found this for $60, such a great buy. y. gets home around the time i finish exercising. eat dinner while watching the last episode of the middleditch & schwartz comedy special on netflix. we're between shows since wandavision ended, sigh.8 p.m. — i build a fire in the chimenea and sit out with some red wine. i'm sure this will be one of the last fires of the season before texas starts heating up for the hot, hot summer, gotta make the most of it while i can. scroll through insta and end up in an etsy shop to buy an enamel coffee mug pin for my sister's upcoming birthday. since i am a sucker for free shipping and this shop is really cool, i end up ordering greeting cards to hit $35. i have a $20 credit in paypal as well. now i've supported a small business and am stocked up on cards for mother's day and a couple of upcoming birthdays, win-win. shower and sleep around 11. $17.37daily total: $103.92day three7 a.m. — up and at 'em before the sun. sit outside with coffee/news articles and enjoy the sunrise before starting work.11a — early lunch between appointments. this last appointment was an intake with a new patient who's really sweet. we got on the subject of travel and now i'm dreaming of europe. can't wait to travel again!1 p.m. — finish up my last appointment for the day and take a couple of hours off for a follow-up appointment with the surgeon who extracted my wisdom teeth last month. get in my car to find... that i have a flat tire. call y. freaking out because this appointment is really important (making sure an infection in one of the sockets is cleared out). ask him if i could air it up and still go, but he says that's a bad idea because the appointment is about 30 miles across the city.3 p.m. — i move my appointment with the surgeon to monday and take my car to a tire shop down the road. while i wait, i go over to a coffee shop i never noticed before. sit outside scrolling insta with an iced cinnamon latte and a piece of carrot cake ($2 tip). the tire shop patches my tire for free and i got deliciousness from a local business that i will definitely return to, guess this afternoon wasn't too bad! $9.744 p.m. — return home and work outside while completing some documentation/e-mails. work late to make up time that was missed, decided not to use pto. y. is going out this evening (probably a good time to mention we're both fully vaccinated), so i'll be doing my own thing, anyway. my introverted self does not mind at all and this is what things look like for us pretty often because he has a lot of work events at bars during normal times.7 p.m. — tired for no apparent reason and am falling asleep while doing documentation. wake myself up enough to manage 15 minutes on the bike and then eat leftovers for dinner while watching to all the boys: p.s. i still love you. i tend to watch heavier things like documentaries about mental health, prisons, etc. but with this *waves arm in general direction of world​* happening right now, i'm sticking to lighter things within my emotional bandwidth.12 a.m. — y. was working across the city today and hangs out with some friends who live in the area after finishing work. i put up some laundry while listening to lady gaga, shower, and scroll through instagram while drinking red wine and making plans for tomorrow. i remember that i am tired when he gets home and flop into bed. y. spends money on dinner and drinks. $43.98daily total: $53.72day four9 a.m. — well, that was a nice sleep-in. coffee while sitting outside and picking a book to start. after perusing my goodreads list, i land on mad, bad & dangerous to know by samira ahmed. happy women's history month! love that my birthday is the cherry on top at the end of this month. i read the first couple chapters and then go inside to do some general picking up/organizing. $11.7411 a.m. — i listen to billie eilish while unloading the dishwasher and wearing a clay/avocado/oatmeal face mask. i love her and gaga both not only for their music but for being so open about their mental health. lady gaga is my hero. it's a beautiful day and y. is helping our neighbors replace their back fence today. they did the section in between our yards recently and today he's helping out on a section we don't share just to be neighborly.12 p.m. — eat lunch and then snuggle with the pups while i start putting together a curbside grocery order. the extra time spent with my dogs is definitely a silver lining of quarantine and one of the perks of wfh. i see an e-mail about a $10 credit promo on beanbox.com that i obviously have to use. one bag of espresso blend beans and one bag of dark roast beans are on their way to me from small roasting companies in seattle! $27.752 p.m. — hop on the exercise bike for half an hour and then do a 15-minute cardio video on youtube. take a quick shower, braid my hair, do my make-up (mostly tarte with a couple of tried and true covergirl items), throw on a denim shirt, black leggings, and black booties. drink another cup of coffee while figuring out why pet insurance didn't cover something on my last vet visit. it's a bit confusing sometimes, but pet insurance is a lifesaver, y'all. one of our pups had heartworms when we first rescued her and pet insurance saved us about $1,000 on treatment.4:30 p.m. — head out for a sunny drive while listening to city and colour. meet my mom and my sister at a winery. i have a glass of red (free because i'm with my sister who works there) and get to use her food discount on a bread bowl of crawfish etouffee. add sister's hummus plate to my tab as thanks, and of course a tip for her co-worker. sit outside enjoying the weather by the grapevines until the sun sets and it gets chilly. $15.307:30 p.m. — head home, listening to megan thee stallion (did i mention i'm from houston), m.i.a., and cocorosie (if you don't know, now you know). y. is finishing a movie when i get home, so i snuggle up on the couch with another glass of red and my book. we go to sleep around midnight. y. ordered chinse food on ubereats while i was out. $30.39daily total: $85.18day five8:30 a.m. — what else would i be doing right now? sitting outside with a cup of coffee and my book. loving this book! it's set in france and giving me major pastry cravings. consult the interwebs about when to try to plant a couple of spring vegetables in my tiny garden. i first tried my hand at this in the fall and nothing sprouted. i think i need to try seedlings instead of seeds this time.10:30 a.m. — i vacuum the house while y. mows the yard and then i go to pick up the curbside order from h-e-b. y'all non-texans are missing out on this grocery store, sorry! i get bread, creamer, iced coffee, sparkling water, yogurt, cheese (sliced and sticks), oat milk, guacamole, frozen meals, fro yo bars, chocolate almonds, soup, chips, granola bars, some cleaning supplies, and cereal. i put up the groceries, then put on make-up and braid my hair (my go-to until i chop off all this quarantine mess next week and donate my hair for the fourth time). it's a little warmer today and i go with a long dress, denim vest, and keds. $119.501:30 p.m. — y. and i meet up with another couple at a restaurant. we order pistolettes, po'boys (popcorn fried shrimp for me), boudin balls, and tip. we end up with fried alligator instead of the boudin balls and decide to roll with it instead of complaining. never had alligator before and it was actually really good. something new! $69.293 p.m. — we all head to a local brewery near the restaurant. i have an ipa and a peanut butter stout. i bask in the sunshine and the fact that this is the first time i've been to a brewery in over a year. side note: my life looked nothing like this pre-vaccination. my anxiety is largely health-related and this pandemic has been an anxiety nightmare for me. therapists, they're people too. hallelujah for science and vaccinations! y. also has a few beers and always tips well. $636:30 p.m. — home and sleepy from day drinking. we start watching crazy ex-girlfriend since i've heard a couple of good reviews of it lately. watch a couple of episodes before y. calls it. i read for a little bit and then hit the hay around midnight.daily total: $251.79day six8:30 a.m. — coffee and reading outside! it's my late morning into work because we each do a late evening once a week to accommodate patients who need evening appointments. i rake up grass clippings for the compost bin. buying a house right before lockdown was so well-timed for me as someone who needs to keep busy. we've replaced all the light fixtures along with most of the blinds in our house and painted all the bedrooms/bathrooms with the money we normally would've spent on traveling!10:30 a.m. — log in to work. i watch a couple of webinars before a team meeting where they tell us they are going to try to lighten our caseload to avoid burnout. bless. i have the best team.2:30 p.m. — after lunch and a cup of iced coffee, i head to the post-op/oral surgeon appointment (for real this time). it's not good news — the infection may not be entirely gone and i need another round of antibiotics. ugh. since i'm in the city, i pop into a lebanese bakery i've been meaning to try. i get a flaky meat pastry and a nutella-filled pastry for tomorrow's coffee, plus tip. houston has a really diverse food scene that i haven't done justice in this diary, but after all, it's crawfish season! $14.265:30 p.m. — i've picked up the antibiotics (about $10 put on my fsa card). i'm home and eat the meat pastry as an appetizer because i hate working out while i'm hungry. 15 minutes on the exercise bike is all i can manage after my bad news today. y. is out at a work event and i spend the evening, predictably, drinking a couple of glasses of red wine and watching to all the boys: always and forever. i make a hellofresh meal of chicken curry, yum! what i've been eating at home for dinner has been all hellofresh, some of them were just leftovers because i ordered multiple portions of one dish. go to sleep around midnight because i am a night owl, no matter how hard i try otherwise.daily total: $14.26day seven8 a.m. — up and at 'em after a cup of coffee. brush my teeth and wash my face (cetaphil wash with neutrogena moisturizer in the morning, curology concoction and olay cream at night #drugstorequeen). i do an appointment with a patient and then watch a couple of webinars. it feels so nice to have a break from having appointments stacked up all day.12 p.m. — i eat chips with guacamole and grilled cheese for lunch. catch up on some documentation, do a 20-minute cardio video on youtube, and i'm in the kitchen around 6 making hellofresh citrus chicken bowls for dinner.8 p.m. — dinnertime! these meals always seem to take longer than they should, maybe i'm just not a fast chopper. i've canceled hellofresh moving forward. we eat dinner and watch a few episodes of crazy ex-girlfriend. we also make an order from freshly because i have a promo code, plus i'm ready for some heat-and-eat meals. i want to spend my long summer evenings outdoors, not in the kitchen! my sister calls around 10 and i accidentally stay up until 1 a.m. (whoops) since i also have to shower and clean up the kitchen after we talk. $81.09daily total: $81.09"

continue to live together for the next year. then her parents told her that if she was interested, they would give her the downpayment for a house. since we agreed to live together for another year, we talked it over together and she ended up buying the house. now i rent from her with a formal lease.)student loans: $30 (my student loans are in deferment because i'm in grad school. i put a little

which is about $45-$70 per monthwas there an expectation for you to attend higher education? did you participate in any form of higher education? if yes, how did you pay for it?there was never a question of whether or not i would go to college. i knew i was going to college because that was the precedent in my family. all four of my grandparents have at least one master's degree, my mom was a lawyer in her home country (she got a master's degree when she came to the u.s.), and my dad has a master's degree. i paid for college a few ways: student loans; an undergraduate research program for minorities in stem, which paid for my tuition balance after my student loans paid out; a little help from my mom freshman year; and some money from my grandparents in my junior and senior years. right now, i am getting my master's degree and that tuition is paid for via a tuition benefit because i work at the university that i attend.growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? did your parent/guardian(s) educate you about finances?i was taught almost nothing about money growing up. during the great recession, i knew my parents were stressed and accumulated a lot of credit card debt. i also watched my dad take financial hits when his real estate investments went wrong. so, i grew up being scared of credit cards but not knowing much else. since college, i've taken it upon myself to learn about budgeting and investing and pass the knowledge along to my younger brothers.what was your first job and why did you get it?my first job was occasionally working in my church's daycare when i was 12. our priest recommended me and i've always been fiercely self-reliant so i jumped at the chance to have spending money. this job led to a summer nannying job for three little girls when i was 13. looking back, i can't believe someone trusted my little 13-year-old self to watch their three young kids. but i did it and was paid very well for it. i have had some kind of job (or more than one) ever since.did you worry about money growing up?yes! as i mentioned above, my parents struggled during the great recession and i was already an anxious child so i absorbed their worry. my dad was also the primary breadwinner for most of my life and felt pressure because of that. a lot of that pressure was often taken out on my mom, my younger brothers, and me. i wanted to start to earn money from a young age so that i wouldn't feel like a burden.do you worry about money now?of course. i wish i made a bit more money now because i would feel more secure and be able to help out my family more. i used to babysit on the side before the pandemic but now that income has gone away and i struggle to find part-time work that can fit into my schedule with work and school. i am optimistic that i will find a job that pays decently when i earn my master's degree.at what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?i became financially independent this year when i was paying or at least contributing money towards all of my bills. if i needed money, i could ask my mom for a little bit or ask my aunt or grandparents. i could also move in with either of them if necessary but it would be my very last resort.do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? if yes, please explain.my grandparents invested in a mutual fund for me. when i turned 21, they turned the account over to me and it had about $10,000 in it. since i'm learning more about investing, i will most likely change it to an index fund soon.day one6 a.m. — i reluctantly wake up and start to get ready for my 7 a.m. pelvic floor physical therapy. i do a very lazy morning routine of micellar water and sunscreen and head out with my water and a pear.8 a.m. — i finish my physical therapy session and realize that my oil desperately needs to be changed. i'm close to my usual mechanic so i stop for an oil change. $37.839 a.m. — i make it back home and log into my work computer. for context, i work as a research assistant on clinical trials. i answer messages from participants, update our databases, and make some phone calls to recruit people into our study.10 a.m. — i stop to make breakfast — scrambled eggs with scallions, cherry tomatoes, and homemade oatcakes with double cream and honey on top.12:20 p.m. — i stop working to have a check-in with my psychiatrist. i've been on ssris for about six months now. i was so hesitant to start taking them at first because i was unsure of how my body would respond to them. but i'm feeling much better now that i'm on them. my co-pay is $20 and i account for this money in my budget every month. $201 p.m. — i make more recruitment phone calls and then stop for lunch. i have some brown rice spaghetti with meat sauce mixed with mac and cheese. i know it's a little weird but it's very good. the energy company comes into the basement to replace the gas line.4 p.m. — i thought i was supposed to have a zoom call with a participant but i had the dates all mixed up. this has been happening a lot more lately and i feel so bad when i get stuff confused like this because i want to be professional and considerate to the participants who take the time to talk to me.5 p.m. — i wallow a little bit while watching desperate housewives. while watching, i order some black kn95 and surgical masks from amazon. i just think the black masks are so chic. i have a $10 amazon gift card that i use to subsidize this purchase. $30.316:45 p.m. — i get a response from my ob/gyn who i messaged earlier today. she has a solution to the issue i brought up and i'm so relieved. i wasn't being listened to when i started having pelvic pain issues and this doctor listened to me and referred me to physical therapy. it's such a relief to be heard by a medical professional.7 p.m. — i turn on some minne ripperton and start my reading assignment for class. i am taking bio-statistics this semester, which is a lot more straightforward than i thought it would be. this week we're learning about linear regression.8 p.m. — i finish my reading and go downstairs to eat dinner. i (usually) meal prep every sunday because i don't have time to cook during the week. i eat my prepped braised chicken thighs, scallion rice, and veggie stir fry. my housemate and i start the latest episode of 90 day fiance while i eat. we are avid fans and watch the show together every week. right now mike and natalie are stressing me out.10 p.m. — i head upstairs to shower and get ready for bed. my nighttime skincare routine consists of cerave foaming face wash, my curology prescription, aveeno moisturizing cream, and a small amount of cerave healing ointment. i also add pfb vanish to some dark spots i've been struggling with on my neck. i'm in bed by 11 and turn on a harry potter audiobook (f*ck j.k. rowling for her transphobia but i don't think i'm giving her any more money by listening to an audiobook on the hoopla app) to go to sleep.daily total: $88.14day two 7:40 a.m. — my sunlight alarm clock goes off and i hit snooze for a while.8:30 a.m. — i actually get up after checking my emails and finding some music to listen to (more minnie ripperton).9 a.m. — i start working. i'm working on qualitative coding this morning. it can be very interesting but i get restless when i have to work on it for long periods of time.12 p.m. — i eat some brunch (fried rice with chicken sausage and some egg with maggi liquid seasoning) and work with less zeal than i did this morning. my friend calls me to tell me he got into grad school! we both have caribbean parents and understand the pressure to achieve academically. although, most of my academic pressure has been self-inflicted.1 p.m. — i have a meeting and do some more recruitment calls.3:30 p.m. — i have a quick facetime call with my boyfriend, m., and then prepare for a zoom data collection.5 p.m. — my first data collection is done and i'll have a ton of paperwork to do for it later. i send off some time-sensitive reports to my boss and supervisor and finally log off at 7.7:30 p.m. — my housemate and i go on a walk around our neighborhood. the city is coming out of hibernation and i love being able to see other people outside again.8 p.m. — we get back and i make myself a drink with peach pear la croix, a tiny bit of gin, and an elderflower and rose cordial i found at world market. i also heat up a cauliflower pizza from aldi in the oven for dinner.9 p.m. — i get into the shower and then do my nighttime skincare routine. i've been trying a new way to preserve my wash and go at night — i use a mesh wig cap with an open top and lay my hair in the direction i want it to go. then i put my bonnet on top. this seems to be keeping it more stretched and preserves my curls better than just putting my bonnet on.9:30 p.m. — i talk to my mom on the phone and then my boyfriend. then i start some pelvic floor stretching with a tool that my physical therapist recommended. i finish runaway bride while i'm doing my stretches. late 90s/early 2000s is my favorite era of movies. i think it's something about the styling (both wardrobe and set) and the pacing that make them feel so different and more calming than more recent movies.11 p.m. — i turn on a harry potter audiobook and head to bed.daily total: $0day three5:40 a.m. — my sunlight alarm goes off. i used to go to physical therapy twice a week and i forgot to disable the alarm. i turn it off and go back to sleep.6:30 a.m. — or i tried to go back to sleep lol. i lay in bed for a while and think about either reading or journaling. i decide on reading. i'm reading honey girl right now. it's the first novel from this author and i wasn't sure that i liked her writing style at first but i'm enjoying the book and the story is so relatable.8:15 a.m. — i finally get up and start my morning routine. i wash my face with cerave foaming wash and use the tonymoly i'm rice scrub. then i add aveeno moisturizing cream, cerave healing ointment, and finish with supergoop unseen sunscreen (two fingers worth even for my melanated, folks!).9 a.m. — i start working and finish my coding from yesterday while listening to the sixth outlander book, a breath of snow and ashes, on hoopla. i refuse to actually read these books because they're so damn long but i am determined to finish the series. sometimes i even listen to them on 1.5x speed because there is just so much description. i make some black tea (i can only drink it with milk and a sweetener) and have scrambled eggs and an oatcake with honey and butter for breakfast.10 a.m. — i make some phone calls and text participants. part of my asos order that i made last week comes and one of the dresses fits. it's gorgeous and brings tears to my eyes (this doesn't take much lol). i haven't put on a dress like this in a very long time.1 p.m. — i have a coding meeting and then go through a survey for a research program that i was in during undergrad. i also call some participants to do appointment reminders.3:30 p.m. — i wrap up work as i'm flexing my time for working late yesterday evening. i head out to cvs and kroger.4 p.m. — i pick up my prescription and grab some lotion at cvs. $11.844:15 p.m. — i head to kroger. i'm making my littlest brother a belated birthday cake this weekend since he was away at school for his birthday this year. his favorite cake is a champagne cake so i get champagne, butter, food coloring, egg whites, and piping bags to make his cake. i also pick up cashew milk ice cream, whole milk greek yogurt, eggs, vegan cookies, and yogurt-covered pretzels. $50.765 p.m. — i make myself a snack with the greek yogurt, honey, and nutmeg. my amazon package of masks comes! then i head upstairs to call participants and get started on my lectures for this week.7 p.m. — okay, i procrastinate a lot but now i'm starting for real. at some point, while i'm watching my lectures, my little brother texts the group chat asking for gas money. i log into my old credit union's banking app and send him $20. i used to bank here and still have a little bit of money left in the account for situations like these. $209 p.m. — i finish watching my lectures and proceed to go down a tiktok rabbit hole. i refuse to download the app on my phone because i don't have enough confidence in my time management skills. but i figured out that i can watch tiktoks to my heart's content on my firefox browser so i end up looking at a ton of videos on #striptok.10 p.m. — i finally get off tiktok and head downstairs to eat dinner. it's the same braised chicken thighs, scallion rice, and stir-fried veggies but i'm not tired of it yet. i also pay my credit bill while i'm eating. i like to pay off my bill in full every month. my mom is an authorized user on my credit card and sends me money to cover her portion every month. the bill total is $1,590.85 but my spending accounts for $862.93. it's usually around $500 but i booked an airbnb this month and have done some damage at asos with my stimulus check. i'm very grateful that my job is secure and that i can afford to spend my stimulus check on things that i want instead of basic needs like rent and food like so many others have been forced to do.12 a.m. — after procrastinating getting ready for bed i finally get up and wash my face. i put on my harry potter audiobook and go to sleep.daily total: $82.60day four7:40 a.m. — sunlight alarm goes off and of course i snooze for a while.8:15 a.m. — i get up and log onto teams for work. no one needs anything from me so i put on some music (my old school daily mix on tidal, which includes stevie wonder, donny hathaway, and of course, more minnie ripperton) and take a shower. my skincare routine this morning is the cerave foaming acne wash, heritage store rosewater toner, aveeno moisturizing cream, cerave healing ointment, and then supergoop's unseen sunscreen on top. i have to be on zoom today, so i put on some eyebrow gel and mascara instead of being completely bare-faced. it's so weird to think that i used to wear a full face of makeup to work every day before the pandemic.9:15 a.m. — i bring down a load of laundry to start and make some tea. there appears to be a bug in the basement so i wait to start my load until my housemate comes downstairs and ask her to kill it for me. i really don't like bugs, like really don't. especially any bug that would be crawling around the basement. my housemate and i have been friends for 11 years and living together for two so she is comfortable with her role as bug-killer in our relationship.10 a.m. — i make some recruitment phone calls and then send out some zoom invites. i also update some of our databases. my rent auto pay comes out of my account. it's only $215 this month because my housemate got all of the stimulus money she hadn't received and is lovely and cuts my rent in half.12 p.m. — i look at the asos app and see that one of my orders has arrived. i immediately go upstairs to try it on. it's a bikini and the top doesn't fit. women's sizing can be so weird and inconsistent. i order a bigger bikini top and a smaller size of another dress i got from asos that doesn't fit. these purchases are coming out of my stimulus money. $7112:30 p.m. — i hurry around and make myself a quick lunch of a microwave baked potato and chicken sausage. i don't have time to eat it before my next zoom appointment so i make myself a cup of tea to sip on instead.2:30 p.m. — i finish my zoom data collection and eat my lunch. then i get ready to drop off a test kit at one of the participant's homes. we started this method because of the pandemic so we don't have to come face to face with people.4 p.m. — i see a charge on my credit card from the nutritionist i'm working with. my payment plan ended last month so i text and ask her to refund the charge.5 p.m. — i'm back home and have to call someone to complete their covid-19 screening. they brush me off and want me to call back at 5:30.5:30 p.m. — well, it turns out that that person has been around someone who has covid so their drop off tomorrow has to be rescheduled. i don't mind as it's one more thing that's off of my plate.6 p.m. — i decide to work out. i've been really into dance cardio lately and have found this youtube channel called and8 fitness. they're twin sisters who do really fun dance workouts and have me sweating with just a 20-minute video. i donate $5 to them afterward because they're awesome. i also pay for the processing fee. $5.467 p.m. — i get into the shower. i eat dinner (more braised chicken thighs and scallion rice but this time with seaweed salad from costco for ~variety~). then i get my last load of laundry from the basement.8 p.m. — i turn on total bellas (i do not care about wwe but started watching total divas when it first premiered and i love the bella twins) and start some homework.9 p.m. — i am determined to fold the piles of laundry around my room tonight so i stop doing homework and fold laundry with total bellas still on.12 a.m. — i finish folding and putting laundry away. i watch another episode while eating some cashew ice cream, which honestly tastes just as good as dairy ice cream, then get up, brush my teeth, and head to bed. with harry potter, of course.daily total: $76.46day five7:40 a.m. — y'all know the deal.8 a.m. — after snoozing, i decide to finish honey girl. i give it four out of five stars. i really enjoyed the story and reading about a young queer woman trying to figure her shit out. i also can relate to having a complicated relationship with your dad and trying to figure out who you are after going so hard in school for such a long time. i think the characters' inner dialogue was written in a very flowery, kinda cheesy way that i didn't love. i also want more from these characters but maybe the author set it up like that so that she can write a sequel. i struggle with not being ""completely straight,"" as i think about it, for several reasons including the aforementioned caribbean parents. so, i am reading more books about queer women in an effort to help me feel more comfortable with myself.8:30 a.m. — i log onto teams and message with my supervisor about a new data collection procedure that got approved and the person who was exposed to covid. we forgot that we wrote out procedures in case this happened and it turns out i can drop off their kit and they will mail it themselves.12 p.m. — do some work and talk to my mom on the phone.2 p.m. — i stop working and eat lunch (braised chicken, scallion rice, and stir-fried veggies) while listening to the most recent episode of my favorite murder. 3 p.m. — my housemate and i decide we want to try this vegan fast food place that is downtown for dinner. they stop doing pick up at 4, so i place the order and head out. i order vegan cheese fries and a gyro with quorn meat. $24.294:30 p.m. — i get back home and finish doing some data entry and submit my mileage reimbursement for the month.5 p.m. — my housemate and i finish work and decide to enjoy some cannabis. i got more into cannabis when michigan legalized recreational cannabis. i usually use it on the weekends, but there was a period of time last summer when it was my only form of anxiety medication and i used it more frequently. detroit has only recently figured out how they want to proceed with recreational cannabis (mi cities can have a vote on whether or not they want to allow its sale) but i am grateful that native detroiters get the first recreational licenses. it's a way to make sure that this will be somewhat equitable as black people have been getting the short end of the stick as recreational cannabis has been legalized in states across the country. i usually buy cannabis every other month or less. i like to get edibles and flower and usually spend $20-$40.6 p.m. — we eat our take out and watch my best friend's wedding. this movie doesn't make an ounce of sense. we don't know who we are supposed to be rooting for but julia roberts looks beautiful as usual.7:30 p.m. — we've moved on to an episode of sherlock for old time's sake.9 p.m. — my housemate puts on pride and prejudice and i start to detangle my hair. i've learned a new way to care for my hair and have completely changed my routine since january.11 p.m. — we finish the movie and i head upstairs and do my nighttime routine. i get into bed and turn on a random tudor documentary on amazon while i facetime my boyfriend. i fall asleep around 1.daily total: $24.29day six 7:50 a.m. — i wake up naturally and lay in bed for a while. i journal for a while and then get up to wash my hair.11 a.m. — i finish diffusing my hair and while listening to a breath of snow and ashes. i go down a youtube rabbit hole for a little while before i realize that i need to eat before my therapy session. i go downstairs and make more oatcakes and eat them with scrambled eggs.2 p.m. — i finish therapy. we talked about how i want to show up in relationships and reframing negative thoughts. i rush out of the house so that i can get to an easter egg hunt that my mom is hosting. my little brother, l., who is just back from school wants to come too so i stop by my parent's house to get him first. $203:30 p.m. — l. and i finally get to the easter egg hunt. there's a really great turnout. we stay for an hour and then head out.5 p.m. — i need gas so i pull up to a gas station and my brother hops out to pump. i just tell him to fill it all the way up. $39.305:15 p.m. — l. is hungry so we stop by a middle eastern restaurant that is close to my parent's house to get him some food. of course, he doesn't have his debit card so i pay. $12.525:30 p.m. — i drop l. off at my parent's house and get a call from m. his car isn't starting and no one wants to help him jump it so i tell him i will come to help him. my elder little brother, j., is having car troubles too so he begs me to drop him off at the mechanic. i follow him to the mechanic and then drop him back off at my parent's house.6:15 p.m. — i get to the mall where my boyfriend's car has stopped working. we get his car started and then go to dinner. 7 p.m. — we eat outside in one of those little igloo bubbles. i have a very mediocre haloumi salad and m. has a tropical salad. the total is $35 with the tip and he pays.7:15 p.m. — there is a liquid nitrogen ice cream place nearby so of course, i have to try it. you get to choose your own mix so it's kind of like getting frozen yogurt. i get cookie butter and cheesecake with a sweet cream base and m. gets oreo with a vanilla base. it comes out to $11.25 and m. pays.7:30 p.m. — m.'s car is not starting again so i have to jump it again. once we get it started, i tell him just to spend the night at my place instead of driving the hour and a half back home. he agrees but heads to see his friend first before coming over. i go home without him.10 p.m. — i finish my homework! i'm a little hungry now so i go down to the kitchen and eat a little bulgogi with rice and chinese broccoli that my roommate made. i also have a small glass of white wine and eat in the kitchen while i chat with my housemate.11 p.m. — my boyfriend gets to the house and we head upstairs to bed. i think we put on something to watch but i can't remember because i'm asleep pretty quickly.daily total: $71.82day seven7:50 a.m. — i'm up.8:15 a.m. — okay, now i'm really up. my boyfriend and i talk and cuddle and then end up fooling around for a little bit.9 a.m. — we get up and i head downstairs to make some breakfast. i make some scrambled eggs and we have oatcakes with double cream.9:30 a.m. — i get started on my little brother's birthday cake but realize i can't find the piping bags i bought anywhere. i even text my housemate but i still can't find them. i get ready to go to kroger again but my boyfriend volunteers to go for me. he's a saint.10 a.m. — i am making progress with the cake and get it into the oven.11 a.m. — the cakes are done so now i start on the icing. i'm trying to get more fancy with my cakes so i make some of the icing pink and some of the icing purple. when the cakes are cool, i ice them but i definitely need better tools so that i can up my game.1 p.m. — i shower and get dressed then head to my to go to my parents' house. i grew up in a neighborhood that was very connected. since leaving, i've realized how unique my experience was. almost all of us were immigrants from different parts of the world and we looked out for each other, carpooled, had barbecues, and provided childcare among other things. i've noticed that this type of connection is atypical among neighbors now so i really cherish my experience growing up. if we weren't in a ponderosa, we would have stopped by easter dinner at my across-the-street neighbor's house. this year we stop to get food buffet-style and then head back across the street to eat.2 p.m. — i pick up a turkey wing, mashed potatoes, collard greens, and mac and cheese from our neighbor. then we sing happy birthday to my little brother and cut his cake.3 p.m. — i need some things at target so my mom and i decide to go. of course, when we get there, it's closed.3:30 p.m. — i drop my mom back off at my parent's house. i really don't feel like meal prepping this week and mention this to my mom so she gets some prepared things out of her freezer and gives them to me. i love her.4 p.m. — i get home and just lay around. i bounce between youtube and instagram. sometimes it feels nice just to do nothing for a little while.6 p.m. — i clean my room and change my sheets. then i get into my pajamas and do my nighttime skincare routine. i am graduating from pelvic floor physical therapy tomorrow morning and want to be in bed on time.8 p.m. — my housemate gets home and we talk for a while. i start his only wife and know i'm going to be hooked on this book. i go to sleep around 10. goodnight!daily total: $0"
3,"today: a social media coordinator who makes $54,300 per year and spends some of her money this week on margaritas.occupation: social media coordinator & consultant industry: construction and hospitalityage: 22location: providence, ri salary: $54,300net worth: $6,000 ($20,000 in savings, $4,500 in 401(k), $4,000 in roth ira minus debt.)debt: $22,500 in student loans paycheck amount (biweekly): $1,426pronouns: she/her monthly expensesrent: $350, i recognize that this is wildly inexpensive. i am very fortunate to have a relative as my landlord and she gives my roommate/sister and i a very generous family discount! student loans: $211401(k): $286 (company matches 75% of what i put in, giving me an additional $214 to this account monthly)spotify & netflix: $0 (suffer through ads and mooch off the family netflix account) health insurance: on my parents until i am 26 car insurance: $120was there an expectation for you to attend higher education? did you participate in any form of higher education? if yes, how did you pay for it?yes, growing up there was always an expectation that i would go to college. there was never pressure applied to the situation though, it was sort of just implied that after high school comes college. i was very lazy about the whole admissions process so it wasn't until november of my senior year that i began really considering how college was going to be paid for. my mom very generously covered the federal loans i was granted, while my dad helped me cover things like housing and meal plans. i was left to cover the rest. i made the decision to commute my junior year of college and took summer classes in order to finish a semester early. i'm grateful for the thousands i saved myself in that year and a half.growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? did your parent/guardian(s) educate you about finances?from a young age, we were taught that if you want nice things you need to work hard for them. i come from a very average middle-class family and thankfully was never concerned about money growing up. i opened a bank account when i was 15 and would try to save as much as possible. my parents would talk to me about my personal finances and tried to guide me to make smart decisions when spending. it was not a topic of conversation often though.what was your first job and why did you get it?at 15, i got a job scooping ice cream. my parents did not force me but explained that i was old enough to get a job and that i would need money to go out and spend time with friends. i never received an allowance growing up but my parents would give me $10 or $20 occasionally if i was going out. throughout high school and college, i always had two jobs. things like car insurance, cell phone bills, and gas were some of my bills as a teen, in addition to all of the fun things i wanted to spend money on. while at times i would get frustrated that i was one of the only one of my friends having to pay for these expenses, i'm so thankful looking back because i learned how to manage, save, and spend my money smartly early on. having a job and not having to ask for money was my first taste of independence and i loved the idea of making my own money.did you worry about money growing up?generally no. my parents never stressed us out with finances or how much things cost. when i was a freshman in high school my mom and stepdad told us that we were downsizing and that is my only memory of being worried about money. as i've gotten older, i recognize that they were wasting so much money trying to run a big house and pay for the lives of four kids. it was definitely a smart financial decision even though i didn't quite understand why at the time.do you worry about money now?yes and no. being only 22, i am satisfied with the money i have saved and do not feel overwhelmed by my student debt. i don't need to think twice if i want to grab dinner with a friend or buy a new outfit. however, i am one of those people who cannot help but think far into the future so i often worry about if i'll have enough to live the life i've envisioned for myself. staying present and realistic helps with these feelings of uncertainty.at what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?at 21, i became fully financially responsible for myself when i moved out on my own. my financial safety net would be my savings. if something were to happen, i have multiple months of expenses saved and accessible.do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? if yes, please explain.no.day one7 a.m. — a work-from-home day, the best way to start the week. i hop out of bed and feel so energized because the apartment is flooded in warm sunlight. i quickly throw on a sports bra and shorts and head to the home gym (a yoga mat in my living room) and pick out which youtube workout i want to do today. i choose a 30-minute hiit video and get to work. after i'm drenched in sweat i take a few minutes to stretch and meditate and then it's time to hit the shower. i am in the process of searching for a new job and today i have four interviews with a media advertising company so i need to look presentable and professional. full blow dry, full face of glossier makeup, and a dress should do the trick. i am ready to go by 8:15 a.m. even though my first interview isn't until 10.8.15 a.m. — now that i am clean and ready i can focus on food. iced coffee with oat milk, a piece of avocado toast, and a just egg omelet sounds like the perfect way to start the week. i sit down at the table and go through my email.9 a.m. — as i enjoy my breakfast i get an alert that my boss has started a weekly coordination meeting that i completely forgot about. i hop on and anxiously listen to the weekly updates, praying that this will wrap up before my interview at 10. we finish up at 9:40 so i calm down for the next twenty minutes until my first interview of the day begins.12 p.m. — one interview down, and time for lunch. i heat up some lemon orzo soup that my stepmom made for me over the weekend and it's delicious. i make myself another iced coffee and settle in for a busy afternoon.4 p.m. — i finish all the interviews for the day and feel tired but confident. they went well and this company has so many things i'm looking for in terms of my next career venture, so fingers are crossed tightly! my stepsister/roommate/bestie, d., texts me and asks if i want to go over to her mom's house for dinner. they live about a mile down the road from us and she always cooks us a delicious meal. i happily accept the invitation, it will be nice to get out of the apartment and i also do not feel like cooking in the slightest.8 p.m. — we get home from dinner and make lunch for work tomorrow.10:15 p.m. — in bed finally and i decide to read a chapter of the four agreements. it always relaxes and zens me out before i sleep. once i've finished reading i throw on a 15-minute sleep meditation and fall asleep before it's even over. daily total: $0day two6:36 a.m. — after three alarms go off, i am up. have to head into the office today so i begin my a.m. routine for the workday, which i have managed to refine to an impressive 14 minutes. i head to the bathroom and wash my face with my body shop tea tree oil face wash and follow it up with my coco-kind everyday spf. after giving my hair a quick brush through, i venture back into my bedroom to pick out today's fit. i settle for black jeans, a fitted black tee, and some gucci loafer look-alikes that are actually from target. black on black always makes me feel ready to conquer anything. i apply some glossier lash slick, boy brow, and a spritz of my favorite perfume, and i'm ready for the day. i made my usual coffee with oat milk and blueberry peanut butter oats. once breakfast and coffee are gone, i quickly brush my teeth and am pulling out of the driveway by 7:25 a.m.8 a.m. — i sit down at my desk and do my usual news, linkedin, email check. after asking my coworkers how their weekends were, i decide it's time to do some actual work. i settle in and cross things off my to-do list.12:30 p.m. — after eating lunch at my desk i decide i'm not quite satisfied, so i leave the office and head over to the east side where i grab a coffee from one of my favorite shops. although it's overpriced, i don't mind supporting a small business! i sip my coffee, blast some music, and drive around the city for about 20 minutes before heading back for the afternoon. $5.504:45 p.m. — phew, done for the day. the afternoon definitely dragged a bit, but the sun is out and i am eager to go home and get a workout in.5:45 p.m. — living room workout complete. i take a half-shower and throw on some comfy clothes. d. calls me from our parents' house and lets me know that we are ordering thai for dinner and our childhood neighbors are coming for a fire in our backyard. i'm excited! we haven't all hung out in a few years.6:45 p.m. — vegan pad thai and nime chow for dinner from our favorite thai restaurant in town. thankfully, my mom and stepdad foot the bill so dinner is free tonight! after we eat, my brother goes out to start the fire before our old neighbors arrive and d. and i head to stop & shop to get ingredients for s'mores. upon arrival we discover they are completely sold out of vegan marshmallows, tragic…but we grab some chocolate, graham crackers, and marshmallows for the rest of the group. i snag a family-size pack of gum at the checkout line. d. pays for everything and i venmo her later on for half. $7.5010:30 p.m. — finally home, and even though i smell a little like smoke from the fire, i am too tired to take another shower. brush my teeth and crawl into bed. after scrolling through tiktok for 20 minutes, it's sleep meditation time. i'm knocked out by 11. daily total: $13day three6:36 a.m. — up and at 'em!! it's hump day which means the weekend is in sight. i'm not one of those people who lives for the weekends by any means, but considering the state of the world, any excitement is good enough for me. wash my face, moisturize, take my hair out of the braid that i slept in, and throw on a white madewell collared shirt, black culottes, and snakeskin flats from target. ready for coffee and breakfast. this morning i decide on toast. one piece sweet and one piece savory. that results in pb and fruit and avocado and tomato. brush my teeth and i'm off to work.12:30 p.m. — after finishing my thai leftovers, i decide my bangs are in dire need of a trim. luckily my hairdresser is a 10-minute drive from the office so i use my lunch break to take care of my hair. the whole process takes about 10 minutes and we chat a little bit about life and how i need to get my hair trimmed before summer. she doesn't charge for bang trims but since i am here every month and a half, i venmo her $10 and we call it even. back to work for the rest of the afternoon. $104:45 p.m. — after work, i meet my friend, f., at the providence pedestrian bridge since it's one of the first truly springy days we've had. we grab margaritas to-go from a restaurant nearby and i pay ( $24 with tip). we go for a walk through the city and enjoy the sunshine and margs. just a quick hangout, but nice nonetheless. $246:15 p.m. — home for the night, and feel the slightest buzz from my margarita. i cook a veggie burger, saute some spinach, have the last of the orzo soup, and wash it all down with a few bites of vegan ice cream (coffee fudge and cookies and cream. yes, i take out both pints at once and alternate taking bites out of both flavors. it's the only way).7:30 p.m. — i take a shower, do a face mask (the ordinary salicylic acid mask is a gamechanger, trust me), and put on pjs. head back into the kitchen and make myself a salad for lunch tomorrow. d. and i talk in her room for a bit, which transcends into a dance party. eventually, i get too tired and retire to my bed.10:45 p.m. — i finish up my part-time job (running an instagram for a local business) for the night and put my phone down. throw on my sleep meditation and pass tf out.daily total: $34day four6:36 a.m. — you know the drill by this point. out of bed, bathroom, wash face, moisturize, brush hair, and pick out an outfit. i make it to the kitchen in record time and make another batch of delicious sweet n' savory toast and can't forget the coffee! it's a rainy day which definitely affects my mood a bit but it's alright because i have a very light workload for the day so it should be a breeze. brush my teeth and i hit the road by 7:30.12 p.m. — due to the fact that i am literally incapable of being in my office all day, i decide to take a drive to whole foods for an afternoon pick me up. i settle on a gingerberry kombucha and a pineapple and berry fruit cup. i return to my car and disassociate for a bit while i enjoy my fruit. i roll the windows down, turn my radio up loudly, and drive around. after about 15 minutes, i decide it's probably best to get back to work. $8.655 p.m. — home from work, woo-hoo. my mom comes over for a walk. this is the primary way we spend time together these days. i used to be an orange theory stan and went running all the time, but for the past year, i've been doing all low-impact forms of exercise due to a back problem i had last summer. i love walking and after a long day of work, it's the best way to clear my mind. mom and i walk about 3.7 miles and talk about my potential new job, my siblings, and whatever other gossip we can think of.6:30 p.m. — home for the night and i finally am cooking this week. i want something easy and healthy so i boil some whole wheat pasta, roast zucchini, onions, and peppers, and saute a vegan sausage and some swiss chard. i mix it all up to create a quasi pasta salad. it's light and refreshing and just what i was in the mood for. after dinner, it's ice cream time. i do my usual two pint taste testing routine and save the rest for the weekend.8:45 p.m. — after taking a body shower, i generously moisturize with coconut oil. my skin is very prone to eczema and coconut oil is one of the best natural remedies i've found. once i look like i'm ready for the oven at 350 degrees, i throw on a light long sleeve and some sleep shorts… i don't want to get oil over my sheets. i crawl into bed and watch some good girls until about 10:30. finish up my side job at 11 and throw on a sleep meditation. lights out almost immediately.daily total: $8.65day five6:36 a.m — finally friday!! i'm always a little extra lazy on friday mornings so i rush through my morning routine and pick out some abercrombie jeans and a sweater. breakfast this morning is blueberry pb oats and i throw a few dark chocolate chips on top because why not?! with a few extra minutes to spare, i decide i'll treat myself to a coffee from starbucks this morning. i grab a grande iced coffee with almond milk no sweetener and am off to work with my new spotify playlist blasting. $3.5112 p.m. — i sneak out of the office to pick up some fresh bread from a local bakery. a loaf of sourdough and a loaf of walnut raisin (they were out of my usual multigrain so i decided to branch out). $173 p.m. — the office gets to head home early today for good friday. it's so funny that no matter your age, fifth grade or 22, an early dismissal from elementary school or your job will always make you so happy. i call my mom and we decide to go for a walk since it's sunny. i stop home quickly, throw on some athleta leggings, a hoodie, and my hot pink lift down beanie (it's a statement piece), and head over to my parents' house. mom and i walk 5.3 miles, a long loop today and the fresh air feels extra good.5:30 p.m. — i head back to the apartment and am feeling absolutely starving and not in the mood to cook. i know d. gets home around 6:30 so i shoot her a text and see what she's doing for dinner. we decide burritos and ice cream are the only option so once she gets home, i drive us to providence to secure the goods.7 p.m. — i pull into an office parking lot across the street so i don't have to park on the street. we run in and grab our food to go and decide to head over to a park by the water to eat ($30 after tax and tip, $15 for my half). on our way out of the parking lot, i pull through the parking spot i'm in, because who doesn't love a pull-through?! turns out there was an obstruction. needless to say, my car bottomed out over a parking barrier and resulted in some pretty terrifying noises. we assess the damage and it looks okay so i try to stay optimistic and calm. $158 p.m. — we make it to the park, eat dinner, and i call my dad to ask for an opinion on what i should do. he advises we take the back roads home and go to the repair shop first thing in the morning. we obviously couldn't go home without some ice cream so we go to our favorite vegan ice cream shop and eat in the car. after that, we crawl home and pray my car doesn't fall apart on the way. $5.609:30 p.m. — i crawl into bed early and watch some more good girls before passing out.daily total: $41.11day six7:20 a.m. — alarm goes off but i've been awake for about 10 minutes now. the car shop opens at 8 a.m. and i want to get there early so i throw on some leggings, a hoodie, and my patagonia and head to my car. thankfully she turns on but is still making less than ideal noises.7:45 a.m. — i make it to the car shop and explain my situation. they let me know that they can look at it right away. the mechanic brings me in the back and points out the damage i did. a busted exhaust hanger and carrier barren has me worried, but he ensures me that it should be an easy fix.8:40 a.m. — an hour later, my car is as good as new, and he only charges me $85. so, so grateful. i head home and since it's not even 9 a.m. i decide to go for a morning walk. i walk around my neighborhood for about 3.6 miles and listen to one of my favorite podcasts, we met at acme. once i get home, i do a 10-minute ab video and decide that it's coffee and breakfast time as my stomach growls on my yoga mat. $8510 a.m. — i make a just egg omelet with spinach and a piece of sourdough avocado toast. paired with an at-home iced coffee, i'm in heaven. soak up the sun for a bit on our porch while i enjoy my breakfast. after i clean up, i hit the shower and do a long weekend spa shower. shave the legs, wash the hair, even throw on a face mask once i get out. i do a full blow dry and throw on a new sweatshirt from abercrombie and some aritzia sweats. queen of loungewear these days. d. and i go down and visit with our landlord/grandma. we chat for about an hour and then come up for some lunch. i have some of my leftover pasta, do some laundry, and lounge for a bit.4 p.m. — my best friend, n., just got out of work so we invite her over to hang out. once she gets here we chat and catch up for a bit, but then decide we're all hungry and in the mood for some cocktails. i play bartender and whip up some gin and tonics for n. and me, and a mojito for d. after happy hour, we place an order for dinner at one of our favorite vegan restaurants. we get nachos, a pizza, a quesadilla, and the most delicious cacio e pepe ever. we bring it all back to the house and make another round of drinks to enjoy with dinner. $169:30 p.m. — n. heads home and d. and i are feeling the effects of our drinks so we call it a night early. i watch some good girls and fall asleep around 11.daily total: $101day seven8 a.m. — wide awake thanks to a sun-soaked bedroom. i don't mind though, i feel very rested. i decide to be lazy and scroll on my phone in bed for about an hour before i get up. chug some water, and brush my teeth before i put on my everlane bike shorts and a sports bra. i do a leg and ab workout in the living room, make myself some toast (sweet n' savory always), and have a coffee.12 p.m. — i feel bored at home so i go to my dad's earlier than i planned. on the way, i stop for more caffeine. it's such a beautiful day that i take my younger brother out for a walk with me. $3.514 p.m. — after some appetizers and a delish gin and tonic made by dad, we sit down for easter dinner. very informal considering there are only four of us. i've really grown to like these lowkey holidays that covid has required. this is my second easter in sweats, and i have to say, i don't know if i'll ever revert back.6:30 p.m. — i take a nap on the couch after we eat and wake up feeling a little groggy. i head into the kitchen and steal some candy out of my brother's easter basket hoping that the sugar rush will revive me. after a couple of handfuls of jelly beans, i'm feeling good. we play a board game as a family and then i decide it's time to get home so i can shower and get ready for work in the morning.9:30 p.m. — i get in bed after packing leftovers for tomorrow's lunch and taking a shower. i journal for a bit, read a chapter of my book, and then i put on legally blonde and fall asleep a little past 11.daily total: $3.51"

any form of higher education? if yes, how did you pay for it?it was an unspoken understanding between me and my mom. i liked school and did well, and college was something that i wanted for myself. i attended a top-ranked private four-year university that offered a significant financial aid package. my education was financed through university-awarded merit scholarship, financial aid assistance (including federal pell grant), loans, outside scholarships (usually <$2,000/year), multiple jobs (~30 hours/week by the time i was a senior), and some help from a generous family member. that family member paid about $25,000 across my four years of school. i graduated with $20,000 in debt that i paid off about one and a half years after graduating with some help (see passive income section).growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? did your parent/guardian(s) educate you about finances?i wouldn't exactly call them conversations. it was more, ""we can't afford that,"" and ""it's too expensive."" any financial literacy i have comes from personal interest in the topic and lots of research and reading. my mom doesn't even have a credit card.what was your first job and why did you get it?my first time being paid was probably babysitting around age 13. my first w2 job was as a lifeguard at age 15. it was the thing to become once you were old enough. my best friends were also lifeguards and it gave me some spending money so i wouldn't have to ask my mom. i saved about a quarter of what i earned each summer.did you worry about money growing up?i didn't always. during my younger years, my family was well-off. then my dad lost his job, and unknown to my mom and family, he kept us afloat via credit cards. we foreclosed on our house, moved into a rental, and then my dad died unexpectedly. also, unexpectedly, he left my family in ~$100,000 of credit card debt, some of which was tied to my mom's name. her credit was demolished. my mom was a stay-at-home mom and suddenly had to re-enter the workforce after 15 years of not working. we moved again, this time into a not-so-well-maintained apartment, and money was a constant issue. we were able to get about two-thirds of the debt dismissed because the cards weren't attached to my mom's name. my extended family cobbled together the money to pay off the remaining amount. still, my mom was barely earning enough to make ends meet for my family. she was very open about our financial situation, perhaps too open at times, and i had a lot of money anxiety. i knew how tight money was but had limited agency of a child and thus no way to really change things. it's taken a lot to move past that anxiety.do you worry about money now?for myself, not really. i do worry about my mom's retirement. she hasn't been in the workforce for very long and in the early years when she was still paying for me and my sibling, she didn't make enough to contribute very much to retirement. sometime this year, i'd like to sit down with her and discuss how much she has saved and how much she needs per month so that i can start planning to help her. i want this to be an in-person, face-to-face conversation, though, so it's covid-dependent. i'd also like to do some investigating about whether she would qualify for widow's benefits when she retires but i want her permission to do so.at what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?i would say when i was 18 and in my second year of college because i was paying for all my living expenses and most of my education, but technically, part of my tuition was paid for by my relative. i was definitely on my own when i graduated at 21. i have an emergency fund that would cover six months of my expenses. i live with my partner (who also has an emergency fund) and either one of us could afford to take on the bills solo if the other lost employment. we both have family that could take us in if shit really hit the fan.do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? if yes, please explain.i received survivor's benefits for almost a decade through the social security administration. i don't know how much this amounted to and i don't care to know. it all went to my mom and was used for exciting things like rent and food. as mentioned in the higher education section, a relative contributed money to my tuition (~$25,000). after my dad died, a lot of people in my town donated to an education fund. i grew up in a relatively small but extremely affluent county, among some families who were very wealthy. my father was very involved in the community and the community was incredibly kind to my family when he died. after a decade of interest and growth, i had about $10,000 to put towards my student loans. i wouldn't be where i am today without these sources of financial help.day one8:05 a.m. — i'm up. my partner, f., is already awake and reading on his phone. eventually, we both get up — he goes to make coffee and start work while i go through my morning skin routine and then make the bed. i settle into my desk (i.e. one end of my dining table) with my coffee and look through my slack messages. i open my browser and look over the products in my chewy cart because i'm adopting a cat!!! i'm so excited!!9:45 a.m. — i update language on a client's webpage and message a colleague to discuss. then i make my usual breakfast shake (banana, frozen strawberries, cocoa powder, peanut butter powder, and chocolate protein powder). after a while, i feel like standing so i adjust my desk (read: pile boxes and books under my laptop and keyboard and raise my monitor). my company offered a whopping $0 for the work-from-home transition. with my boss' approval, i borrowed a monitor from the office because my tiny 13-inch laptop makes it hard to do design and web work.1:10 p.m. — i break for lunch and have leftover thai-curried quinoa salad with mixed greens. we're low on mixed greens, so i bulk it up with some roasted chickpeas, cauliflower, and red onion that i prepped over the weekend. i plop on the couch to finish an episode of criminal minds while i eat. i finish updating the content from earlier and then move to a different part of the website to add some additional content. the sun is finally shining so i go for a walk. **for brevity, i do not mention putting on a mask or washing my hands whenever i leave or return home, but i take covid precautions seriously.**3 p.m. — get back home and i make an iced chai with vanilla soy milk and oregon chai mix. i update some project files to prepare for a client meeting, update an online form, and then get started on some design work.5:30 p.m. — finish the design work and decide to sign off for the day. i stay at my desk to pull the trigger on the chewy order. i buy toys, a bed, litter and accessories, a drinking fountain, a carrier bag, scratcher toys/posts (including one that looks like a sardine tin, it's too cute!), and a grooming kit for $390.41. i'm a strategic credit card user and rotate through my cards based on deals and where i'm shopping. this purchase is made with my citi double card and will earn 2% cashback. i have a dedicated ""cat fund"" to pay for start-up pet ownership costs so this expense will not impact my monthly spending and savings goals. i check on the red beans and rice that i started earlier in the day and make cornbread muffins and roasted broccoli. f. and i eat, hang on the couch, and chat about our day. $390.418 p.m. — f. cleans the kitchen while i work on a jigsaw puzzle. i highly recommend the new yorker series by the new york puzzle company. right now, i'm working on a puzzle of the cover of a 1961 winter issue with a drawing of ice skaters in a snowy central park.10 p.m. — i get ready for bed. i'm out of facial oil and winter has sucked all the moisture out of my already parched skin, but i overspent in another category this month so i'm holding off until next month to make the purchase. in bed around 10:30.daily total: $390.41day two8:00 a.m. — wake up, scroll through my phone, get ready for the day.9:10 a.m. — i make some iced coffee, settle into my desk and check my email — nothing new since last night. i'm an avid budgeter and excel nerd so, of course, i've decided that i want to track all my pet-related expenses. as last night's chewy purchase is not being paid for by my monthly paychecks (because as i mentioned before, i had dedicated funds set aside for the start-up costs), i create a new tab in my budget and will use a formula to pull in expenses like food and litter that will occur in future months so i can get a sense for my yearly pet costs.10 a.m. — weekly meeting with my team where we share updates on projects. then i make my usual breakfast shake and message with a colleague about how to use a specific function of our cms. then i get started on some design work.1:15 p.m. — design work is done so i break for lunch: veggie burger on a toasted english muffin with a fried egg and a side of roasted chickpeas and veggies. i watch some criminal minds while i nom.3:15 p.m. — client status meeting to go over projects and other communications.3:15 p.m. — tutoring lesson. pre-pandemic i babysat as a side hustle; now i zoom tutor. when the lesson is done, i record the time and head back to work to review some mass emails scheduled for today and later this week.5:15 p.m. — i sign off for the day and decide to take a walk. while i'm out, i pick some things i missed from last week's grocery shop (i swear there was tofu in the freezer!). i went with the intention of just getting one container of tofu and some broccoli because i'm already over my grocery budget, but i'm a sucker for a buy one get one free so i end up with english muffins, broccoli, and tofu. i use my discover card because it offers 5% cashback on groceries this quarter. i usually earn the full amount ($75) in cashback because i buy all the groceries for the household. $13.476 p.m. — i get back and start a workout. i used to lift a lot before covid back when i belonged to a bougie gym. it's obviously not the same at home — not just the lack of equipment but also, it's hard to get in the right mindset. i do take solace in not forking over all that $$$ for a gym membership. i roast some more broccoli to go with the leftover red beans and rice. when dinner is ready, f. and i watch how i met your mother while we eat. after a few episodes, he has to hop back on his laptop for work so i offer to wash up and turn on criminal minds to keep me company.9:30 p.m. — i do my skincare routine and lament the cosmic injustice of having both fine lines and acne. i get in bed and open my book, the alienist, by caleb carr. i decided to re-read it after watching the hbo show and feeling like they changed a lot of things.... my memory was right, they did change a lot of things, and not for the better! lights out at 11:45.daily total: $13.47day three7:30 a.m. — f. wakes me up after his early morning call. a personal wake-up is infinitely better than an alarm clock! i do my skincare routine and head out for a walk.8:45 a.m. — the wind is treacherous, so i cut my walk a bit short. when i get home, f. and i make the bed and then i whip up some dalgona coffee. it was a tiktok/insta trend at the very beginning of lockdown (less than 12 months ago for nyc but truly feels like 800 months ago) and it has become a favorite in this household. it's fancy and beautiful and curtails my nostalgia for coffee shop drinks. then i settle into my desk, check emails, and begin working on action items following yesterday's client call. i get stuck writing an email so i decide to take a break to check on my bank and investment accounts. i am a compulsive account checker.11 a.m. — it's like cat christmas! eight boxes arrive from chewy. i really want to open them all and relish in the glory but limit myself to opening just one. i open the box that contains the tunnel-shaped bed and it is so cute and soft and i can't wait for a kitty to sit inside!! alas, i return to work so i can make more money so i can buy kitty more stuff. it's a vicious cycle. at some point, i realize i'm hungry and haven't eaten anything, so i make soft boiled eggs to go on toasted english muffins with a side of roasted veggies.2 p.m. — i'm supposed to be on a call but the other person is a no-show. when it becomes clear he isn't dialing in, i email him to reschedule.3 p.m. — tutoring lesson, then return to work.5 p.m. — team social hour. i'm lucky to work with a really great group of smart, funny people who are as pleasant to hang with as they are to work with.6:30 p.m. — i really should make dinner but i just don't feel like it so instead i finish opening the boxes from chewy. i attempt to assemble the cat bed but it turns out you need the grip strength of the hulk to get the screws in place. i'm annoyed that i need to use a drill (instructions say power tools not recommended) but that does the job. f. and i eat leftover red beans and rice (again) and watch how i met your mother (again). he washes the dishes from today and i struggle to stay awake. i get ready for bed, move to the bedroom, and fall asleep watching criminal minds.daily total: $0day four7:45 a.m. — wake up, get ready, and make the bed with f. he lets me have the leftover coffee in the fridge so i can make iced coffee and he brews a new pot.8:45 a.m. — i settle into my desk and check my bank accounts because it's payday! i send $1,500 to my roth ira and update my budget. i was over budget in some places this month but managed to keep my roth ira contribution high because i received a bank opening bonus (i churn bank accounts for bonuses). then i get to work scrubbing our e-newsletter audience and scheduling the email for next week.10:15 a.m. — i make my usual breakfast shake and then get started on an assignment for a workshop i'm participating in. today is pretty slow and i'm really struggling with motivation so i make a list of the things that absolutely must get done today and tell myself that when they're done (and my meetings are over), i can sign off. if i commit, that potentially means ending my day at 3. i'll monitor my email via my work phone after i sign off, but my boss is generally supportive of leaving a little early.1:15 p.m. — i cross three things off my must-do-today list so i take a break to meal plan. this is a typical friday habit; i meal plan on friday, shop on saturday, meal prep on sunday. i really don't like to grocery shop without a list (how do you know what to buy if you don't know what you're going to eat??) so meal planning happens every week. then i finish off the thai-curried quinoa salad and roasted chickpeas and veggies for lunch.2 p.m. — i participate in a cross-department workshop. then i run through a rough draft of a video and compile my feedback.3:30 p.m. — done with work! i head out for a walk, get back and check my email, then hop on my peloton. i decided to mix things up a bit and take a rock class instead of a 2000s-themed one. i guess change is good because i broke my 30-minute pr! *finger guns* pew pew pew.7 p.m. — i get started on dinner: baked tofu sandwich with ginger-peanut butter spread. we watch wandavision while we eat and then i make cocktails (whiskey-amaretto sour with moonshine-soaked cherries). in bed around midnight.daily total: $0day five8:30 a.m. — i wake up, do my morning skin routine, and start working on my puzzle. f. cleans up the kitchen from last night's dinner and i make myself breakfast: toasted english muffin with veggie sausages.12 p.m. — back-to-back tutoring lessons.2 p.m. — finish tutoring and join f. on the couch. he's been working since i started the tutoring sessions but tells me he took a break to refill our weed gummy stash: five packs (500mg total/bag) of gummies for $100. f. paid. i eat leftovers and head to the store to pick up groceries: bananas, yellow onion, red onion, garlic, pineapple, avocados, lemon, limes, portobello mushroom caps, tomato, jalapeno, serrano pepper, red pepper, broccoli, cilantro, mixed greens, cauliflower, pears, chickpeas, tortillas, skirt steak, pasta, pasta sauce, soy milk, almond milk, frozen strawberries, tofu, jam, greek yogurt, eggs, mexican shredded cheese, gummy cherries, and some loose can sodas and seltzers. $94.136:30 p.m. — i start prep for our annual tacos, taxes, and tequila tradition. we've found that taxes suck less when paired with tacos and margaritas, and who doesn't appreciate some good alliteration? we start our taxes and break for strawberry margaritas once we're about halfway through our federal returns. i pay turbotax $87.10 to file my tax returns and expect federal and state refunds of $814 and $215, respectively. i'll probably spend about $100 of my tax refund (i'm thinking of new leggings from the girlfriend collective) and use the rest to max out my roth ira. we finish making and eating the tacos, split a gummy, make some popcorn, and fall asleep on the couch watching how i met your mother. psa: if your agi is under the irs-set threshold, you can file for free. i should have done more research before starting my taxes because i had major technical difficulties when i tried to use one of the free versions and just didn't have the patience (i wanted my taco!!) to figure it out. yes, i'm aware that i basically paid a $90 convenience fee. $87.10daily total: $184.23day six9:30 a.m. — i wake up and finish my puzzle! f. washes the dishes from last night and makes us an omelet and toast. we decide to turn the chewy boxes into a cardboard castle fort for our future cat. it's hilarious and adorable, with multiple levels, a bridge, and a perch. i dig some old blankets out of a closet and use them to cozy up a few of the fort's hidey-holes.2:30 p.m. — we fridge forage for something to eat that doesn't require much work and settle on random leftovers. i prep my lunches for the week: yellow coconut curry with cauliflower and crispy tofu. while my curry cooks, i also make vegetable broth. i save scraps from onions, mushrooms, celery, carrots, and some herbs in the freezer. the process takes about 90 minutes and i end up with 10-12 cups of broth. this helps offset my cooking costs a teensy bit (i make a ton of soups and stews, especially in the winter) and makes me feel good about reducing waste.5 p.m. — we get a text from f.'s mom that a package was delivered to us, and it's another puzzle! this one is from the harry potter collection, my other favorite series from the new york puzzle company. apparently, i've rekindled f.'s family's love for puzzles and they've all been on a puzzle kick since christmas. f. and i decide to order takeout from a new restaurant in our neighborhood. we each order half a chicken with two sides and split an order of mac and cheese, a caesar salad, and a slice of cheesecake. they have a 10% discount for first-time orders. the total is $71.22, f. pays. we have a bunch leftover and can probably get another meal out of this. i watch criminal minds while f. plays on his computer. we head to bed around 10:30.daily total: $0day seven7:45 a.m. — i get up, shower, and then wash dishes from last night's dinner. not that we're planning on moving anytime soon, but we have already agreed that our next apartment absolutely must have a dishwasher. that's an upgrade we're ready to pay extra for.9:15 a.m. — i make some iced coffee and settle into my desk and check my email. today is going to be slow. i update my budget to reflect purchases made over the weekend. i upload pics of my receipt to some cashback apps (receipt hog, receipt pal, and fetch) and then work my way through emails.1 p.m. — i break for lunch. i eat the remainder of the caesar salad and some curry. then i have a call and a tutoring lesson.3:30 p.m. — i finish drafting talking points for an exec in my department. i send the draft to my boss and another colleague for feedback. this is my first time drafting talking points and it was more fun and challenging than i expected. i wrap up my day with some design work.5 p.m. — i move to the couch to play some computer video games while f. makes enchiladas. we watch himym and then i clean up the kitchen. i convince f. to put on criminal minds and then promptly fall asleep. eventually, i get up to my skin routine and get in bed around 11.daily total: $0"

car payments making minimum wage, so i earned an rotc scholarship that took care of my tuition and applied to colleges. my dad paid for my room and board, which i paid back after i graduated. i worked part-time in college to pay for groceries and gas.growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? did your parent/guardian(s) educate you about finances?my dad always took me to the bank with him when he needed to run errands. he explained to me how he put everything in savings except for the money he was okay spending, and how he figured out what percentage of his paycheck should go into the spending category. the idea of interest compounding the sooner you put your money into the bank stuck with me even when i was little. i knew that i could put money away when i didn't need it and it would turn into more money in the future. a guy i dated in college explained i should open an ira even before i started working, so i started mine when i was 19.what was your first job and why did you get it?my dad didn't want me to work when i was in high school. he grew up supporting younger siblings (his younger siblings were orphaned when he was 21 and they were minors) and i think he didn't want me to feel stressed or burdened about financial hardship. i also think he didn't have the money to help me get a car or the time to drive me to work anyway, so my first job was working in a cafeteria when i was in college after i left home. this money was what i used for groceries and going out.did you worry about money growing up?no. i know my mother clipped coupons and planned our meals based on what was on sale or in season, and that my parents would carpool to save gas, and that we didn't have cable because it was expensive. we also didn't take family vacations. however, my parents definitely spent money, investing in my sister and me and supporting us in different hobbies and activities. there was always money for me to get a musical instrument or my sister to get new running shoes for track, but we didn't get fancy electronics as holiday gifts like a lot of my friends did.do you worry about money now?not really. i don't travel much right now due to covid and i don't have any ""expensive"" hobbies that require me to buy equipment and gear. my biggest expense is food. i barely buy anything else, and i know that i could even cut down on the snacks and eating out if i had to.at what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?22. i wasn't paying for my own rent when i was in college — i paid for about half my living expenses. my safety net was my parents. now i'm on my own, and i think if i absolutely needed help, i could ask, but i am very resistant to that idea. i'd have to have less than $1,000 in the bank to go to them for something like rent or food.do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? if yes, please explain.nope!day one6 a.m. — i wake up early, at 5:20. it's still dark outside but i'm excited because it's a friday and i'm planning on making today a half-day. i hit snooze for ten minutes, getting out of bed at 5:30. i rush through getting ready and catch a train at 5:50 ($2 to swipe my train pass). i respond to facebook messenger and texts as i ride the train in. i usually wake up to some messages because while i sleep, my friends in the states are still awake and send me things. $212 p.m. — after a busy morning at work, i go on a run during my lunch hour. the weather is beautiful, sunny, and mid-60s and it's too nice to resist. i drink a chocolate milk box i have at the office.3:30 p.m. — i walk to the pizza hut that is next to the pier that my ship is on and buy some breadsticks ($3.50). i am not sure when i'll be getting dinner because i'm supposed to leave around 4 for a spontaneous road trip this weekend. it's the second weekend i've been allowed to do something besides be at home or work (covid-19 precautions), and some friends booked an airbnb over the weekend at the base of mt. fuji. i venmo a friend ($90) for my two-night stay. $93.505 p.m. — the trip is off to a semi-late start. my friend and i are driving together and we stop to get gas. i run into the mini-mart and get gum, granola, and candy ($17.48). when i get back to the car, my friend and i realize we don't have an exact address to go to, just the city we're planning to visit. while we wait to receive the airbnb address from the friend who made the booking, i run back inside to pick up some hard cider and lemonade for the evening's festivities ($34.35). since i didn't pay for gas on the trip, i offer to pay the tolls ($12.40). $64.23daily total: $159.73day two9 a.m. — after a night celebrating the fact that the group could actually go on this trip (we're all vaccinated with some restrictions lifted), i'm the first to wake up in the airbnb. i make a mug of tea and look through a magazine on the coffee table. it has an ad for a breakfast spot nearby and i convince everyone that waffles are the way to go for breakfast. one of my friends picks up the bill, so waffles are on him!12:30 p.m. — japan is famous for its onsens and i'm determined to go and relax at one since i haven't been allowed to in over a year. my friends and i drive to one that is accepting of guests with tattoos (usually a taboo) and i break off from my friends to go alone into the women-only bath. i pay cash for my entrance fee. later when i get out of the baths, i realize i should've brought or purchased a towel. oh well. i drip dry before changing into clean clothes. $86:15 p.m. — after the relaxing onsen, we decide we want to get massages. i pay $60 for a 30-minute foot and calf massage and a 60-minute body massage. i can hear another person so relaxed that they have fallen asleep and are snoring on the massage bed next to mine. $608 p.m. — after a full day driving around and relaxing, my friends and i stop at a ramen place for dinner. we all try different types of ramen (i opt for pork and vegetables) and i end up paying for the group. $72daily total: $140day three9 a.m. — my friends and i get up and decide to visit a gem museum. i pay cash for the entrance tickets for myself and two friends. $1810:15 a.m. — we are back at the waffle place for brunch! this time i order a basil and tomato sandwich and it's amazing. the tomatoes are piping hot, so i go with a brownie and ice cream for dessert. i pick up the bill for this breakfast for my friends. $54.4512:30 p.m. — after eating, we take a gondola up a mountain with amazing views of lake kawaguchi and mt. fuji. i pay for my ticket ($5) and enjoy the short ride. i do not mind heights. at the top, i pay for a small fortune at the shrine ($1). it's a good one! i pick up some souvenirs at the top to send to friends before we hike down ($22.32). $28.323 p.m.— after the natural beauty of the mountain and lake, we go to the aokigawahara forest for a short hike. while walking, we decide to see some famous caves formed from lava tubes. i pay my entrance fee ($3) and prepare to duck through a lot of small spaces. $35 p.m. — everyone is tired and ready to head home from the weekend. i wanted to find a smaller restaurant, but the group votes for a well-known sushi chain. i eat and stack my plates. we pay and hit the road home, opting for a scenic and toll-free route. $15.25daily total: $119.02day four5:50 a.m. — another early train ride to work ($2). i definitely stayed up too late the night before, video calling a friend. i'll be on the ship all day today. i skip breakfast and munch on chips for lunch. not the healthiest, but it's my duty day so i cannot leave the ship to pick up something else food-wise. i stay on the ship working all day long. $26 p.m. — i eat a cup of annie's mac and cheese for dinner before my evening workout. i buy 12 packs of these cups on amazon whenever i run out. i work out and then go to bed on the ship. daily total: $2day five6 a.m. — i wake up on the ship today and skip breakfast per my usual routine.12 p.m. — at lunch, i'm really hungry so i walk to an on-base cafeteria and order japanese curry and rice. $55 p.m. — now that we are allowed to eat in restaurants again, i take two friends to an udon restaurant they've never been to before. since i treated him to a few meals over the weekend, one of my friends pays for my dinner.6:30 p.m. — we aren't allowed to go to bars, so after dinner, my friends and i go to a convenience store to buy a drink ($1.51), which we (classily) drink in a park before our 8 p.m. curfew. canned chuhais come in different ""strengths"" (alcohol content) and flavors and are pretty cheap. i take the train home ($2). $3.51daily total: $8.51day six6 a.m. — the usual morning train to base ($2). i made a 2021 resolution to buy no drinks in plastic bottles, so as tempting as a morning coffee or tea from the vending machine at the train station looks, i ignore them. $25 p.m. — after my clif bar breakfast and running through my lunch break, i'm so ready for dinner. i have spent the whole day thinking about going to my favorite cafe. the woman who runs it has a changing menu board based on what she feels like cooking that day. today, i decide on her roasted chicken. the meal set includes soup, salad, fresh-baked bread, and tea at the end of the meal, and it's phenomenal. i could eat here every night. the quality of food is miles above what i could make. if i wasn't so full, i would stay for dessert too. $16.517 p.m. — after that delicious meal, i wish i could stay outside and walk around. unfortunately, the curfew is still in effect and i take an early train home. $2daily total: $20.51day seven6:20 a.m. — i wake up to a dead phone which means i slept through my alarm. i change in literally two minutes and run for the train station, catching the last train i can take without being late ($2). i have to run from the train station to the ship, so i roll into work sweaty and holding nothing but my id card, a credit card, and some cash rubber-banded together in my pocket. it's easier to run when everything you carry is lightweight. $25 p.m. — i ate a cliff bar and some pistachios from my snack drawer at work throughout the day, so i take the train home ($2) and get to dinner hungry again. i order ramen at my favorite spot in my neighborhood. i choose curry ramen with an extra egg and yuzu juice to celebrate the end of the week ($11.01). i accidentally thought it was friday the whole day, and i'm going to keep up the end-of-week mindset. $13.01daily total: $15.01"

there an expectation for you to attend higher education? did you participate in any form of higher education? if yes, how did you pay for it?my parents always wanted me to go to college when i was a kid. my mom was a high school dropout and my dad worked at a welding supply store so neither of them had a degree. i started going to college in high school as part of a program that gives juniors and seniors free tuition at local community colleges. i transferred to a four-year college when i was 18 but got pregnant and left college soon after. i was briefly married to the father of my kids, but we split up a few years later, i was 21 with three kids, no degree, and no real work experience outside of my college newspaper. i started working for websites at a salary that was lower than childcare costs and relied on state childcare assistance for three years to barely scrape by. i was lucky and was able to transition into higher-paying content jobs in tech and by the time i was 25, i was making just shy of $100,000. i completed my degree while working full-time and eventually went to grad school, which i graduated from last year. i paid for all of my college myself, which is why i have so much student loan debt. my parents were never in a position to help me financially at any point since i became an adult.growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? did your parent/guardian(s) educate you about finances?none, really. i had no idea how to build credit, save, or invest, and because my parents wouldn't let me get a job as a teenager, i had no access to spending money or experience managing money until i was on my own in college.what was your first job and why did you get it?my first job was working on the student newspaper in college. i loved to write so i tried to find ways to make money that built those skills. i also worked on student government, for the women's studies program, and in the college bookstore. i couldn't get enough aid to cover living or food costs so i worked multiple jobs to try to cover those expenses.did you worry about money growing up?not really. i never thought about finances growing up, largely because we lived in a pretty poor california town where everyone seemed to be in the same boat. we shopped at k-mart and ate hamburger helper and kraft mac and cheese. i went to disneyland once and the only other vacations we took were camping trips or very rare visits with family in other states.do you worry about money now?as a single parent living in a high cost of living area, i've been through a number of periods of pretty dire financial straits. i'm in a good place now, largely because my kids are old enough not to need childcare anymore. i have been so broke, i've had to look for change to buy food and spent years juggling shut-off notices to try to keep everything on. at one point, my credit score was 450 and i had creditors garnishing my wages. it took me a long time to dig out of that hole so even though now i'm financially stable, i don't feel safe and probably won't until i have enough money saved to cover my expected expenses through the end of my life.at what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?18. i've been responsible for myself and my kids ever since.do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? if yes, please explain.i received $5,000 when one of my grandparents died, which i used to pay off a debt to my college so i could return to school and finish my degree. when my father died, i received $20,000 from the sale of the land his mobile home sat on. i used that to help my oldest child buy their first home.day one9 a.m. — i usually start my workday between 8:30-9. right now, i'm working from home so i pretty much roll out of bed, put on joggers and a hoodie, put my hair in a ponytail, and get to work. i eat a protein bar and start reading my email and preparing for a day full of meetings. my son texts me to see if i want coffee. he has my starbucks card on his phone so he grabs me an almond milk mocha and drops it off between errands. i usually make my own coffee but i'm always up for more. $612 p.m. — one downside of working from home is back-to-back meetings. i used to make time to grab food from the cafeteria once or twice a week, but now i eat leftovers during meetings. today i have leftover swedish meatballs, mashed potatoes, and peas from last night's dinner. yum!8 p.m. — i love to watch the food network and recreate my faves with my kids. i want to try to make oreo macarons but i don't have a food processor. i find one on amazon for $230 and use some of my amazon credit card reward points so it's only $93. i do all of my grocery and household shopping on amazon with their credit card so i have $200-$250 in rewards points to use every month on something fun. $93daily total: $99day two10 a.m. — it's saturday! i sleep in and do my grocery shopping from the couch. i load up my cart while my kids play and there's enough to fill two whole foods orders and one from amazon. combined, they're $456 plus $20 tips. i used to go to three grocery stores to get everything we needed at the absolute lowest price, but these days, i'm all about freeing up time even if it costs more. i spend the afternoon reading a book. $4565 p.m. — pre-pandemic, my family ate out... a lot. these days, we've cut back to once a week. this week, we decide to try a new asian-mexican fusion place that just opened up in the neighborhood and is offering pickup. my kids get sandwiches and fries, and i try the loaded spicy pork fries with mexican roasted corn. delicious! it was absolutely worth the $108 (with tip) and i post pics of our meal to social media to let my local friends know how good it is. $1086 p.m. — the kids have been begging for a movie night so i make popcorn and dig up some candy for the theater experience. they settle on a new disney release on disney+, which is $30 plus the cost of disney+ itself, but that's a bargain compared to seeing it in the theater for my crew. $30daily total: $594day three9 a.m. — i got a peloton early in the pandemic and promised myself i'd use it four to five days a week. these days, i'm lucky if i work out more than once a week. exercise has never been my friend but i'm determined to get some use out of this thing. i work out for a grueling 45 minutes and have to admit that i feel great afterward.6 p.m. — after a quiet day at home, cleaning and organizing, i settle in to catch up on instagram. as usual, they get me with a targeted ad, this time for a lint roller for rugs and furniture. who knows if it'll work but as a pet owner, i'm willing to try anything! $19daily total: $19day four9 a.m. — get up and start working.2 p.m. — i manage to snag a covid vaccine appointment, which is covered by my insurance. i log out of work and head to my appointment. the only parking available is paid so i swing into the lot. the vaccine clinic is run out of a large hospital and it works like clockwork. i'm in and out in 15 minutes, but still owe $9 for parking. i run through the starbucks drive-thru on my way home and get my afternoon usual, a venti iced peach green tea with two stevias. $158 p.m. — i'm starting to feel a bit under the weather so i spend the evening watching ginny & georgia on the couch and shopping for raincoats for my dog. i find a cute one for $25 and use my amazon points to snag it for free.10 p.m. — my oldest kid is buying a house and texts to see if he can use my home depot credit card to buy a washer and dryer. he promises to pay me back after the house closes. i agree but decide to gift him the set as a housewarming gift. we text back and forth from the store until he chooses a stacking set with a three-year warranty. i didn't have help from my family when i was his age so it's important to me to be able to do things like this for my kids. $2,500daily total: $2,515day five11 a.m. — now that i have my first vaccine, i realize i can finally go back to the salon! i haven't had a haircut or color since quarantine began and things are looking rough. i text my favorite salon and it's a good thing i did because she moved to a new location. i book an appointment for after my second vaccine and pre-pay for the service. $2502 p.m. — a friend tells me about a board and train program her dog is going to so i start looking into them for one of my dogs who is very anxious. after reading all about them, i'm feeling super excited about enrolling my pup. i'm able to connect with them quickly so after discussing my dog and her needs, we agree to a four-week program for her. i put 50% down to hold her spot. $2,5008 p.m. — i'm feeling restless after being cooped up at home for a year and have plane ticket credits to burn after having to cancel a trip to disney world last year. i'm able to rebook the tickets without any fees because of the pandemic and i settle on a week in kauai in late november when it seems safe. i spend the night looking for the perfect airbnb for the whole fam and settle on a large house with a pool and hot tub for $8,000. i put down a $1,700 deposit and add my pto to my work calendar. $1,700daily total: $4,450day six10 a.m. — i'm really lucky to have medical care that's almost entirely covered by my employer. i pay a few bucks for prescriptions, $10 co-pays for office visits, and have free mental health care. i take advantage of the mental health benefit to schedule a visit with my therapist. i've been struggling with depression for most of my life but the pandemic has made it harder to cope. i'm feeling overwhelmed and exhausted, but meeting with her helps me to feel more in control. i log into my next meeting feeling ready to tackle my workday.6 p.m. — i forgot some things in my weekly grocery order so i hop back onto the amazon app to order a few essentials. i'm obsessed with rebbl protein shakes lately so i load up on those, plus add more zevia (a sad replacement for my beloved diet coke), and my fave non-dairy ice cream. $8010 p.m. — instagram ads get me again with a hand-lettering journal. i took a hand-lettering workshop at work a few months ago and found it oddly relaxing. i'm always trying to find ways to decompress so i'm excited for it to arrive. before bed, i write in my daily mood journal, drink a glass of water, and meditate on the peloton app. $35daily total: $115day seven10 a.m. — it's been a long work week already and i take advantage of a break between meetings by looking at real estate. i've been thinking about moving to a warmer, sunnier state if my company continues to let us work from home after covid, and looking at cheap real estate is my new favorite hobby. it's pouring outside so sunny states with nice homes with pools for way less than my mortgage feels like perfection.3 p.m. — barkbox arrives and it's the best part of my month (how sad is that?). my dogs are super excited about their new toys and i snap a few pics and post them to their instagram account. i never saw myself as a dog mom but here i am. (in monthly expenses above.)12 p.m. — it's cleaning day! i started treating myself to house cleaning twice a month a few years ago and it's a total lifesaver. while they clean, i continue my meetings but have to keep my camera off so it's not weird. i zelle my cleaning lady $130 plus a $20 tip when she's done and enjoy my pristine house until the kids mess it up! (in monthly expenses above.)10 p.m. — before bed, i check in on my investments. the market has been crazy lately so i often gain or lose $1,000 or more per day. i am new to investing and saving but i am taking a long view of my investments. i have another 20+ years until retirement so i try not to stress out when my balance is down. today it's up $1,100 and i'm overwhelmed with gratitude for the ability to save for my future.daily total: $0"

that i would go to college. both of my parents went and i was always a high-achieving student so i felt my whole life that it was important i go to a top-tier school. my parents paid for my college in full, which was an unbelievable gift. when i chose my school, which was way too expensive, a part of that agreement was that i would pay my parents back $40,000 for part of my tuition. they wanted to be sure i had some financial responsibility, but they really eased me into it because i don't have to pay them any interest. i started paying them back eight months after i graduated college, once i had been working my first job for a few months and had gotten somewhat comfortable with my finances. i pay them in lump sums twice a year and will pay them the last $4,000 that i owe them in may or june.growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? did your parent/guardian(s) educate you about finances?my parents always talked about the importance of saving money and they opened a bank account for me when i was a kid. whenever i got money for birthdays or christmas, it went into that bank account. money conversations were fairly high level, but i definitely was taught to save every penny that i can. one of my parents' favorite stories involves them ""saving beyond their means"" right after their wedding and eating one meal a day so they could put a down payment on a house.what was your first job and why did you get it?i started babysitting for family friends when i was 13 and did that all through high school. my first job in an actual workplace was at a frozen yogurt store the summer before i started college, but they paid me cash under the table so i'm not sure if that fully counts either. my first on-the-books job was as a dishwasher in the dining hall freshman year of college, which i did three to four nights a week because i was very stressed about how much money my parents were paying for school and i wanted to help however i could.did you worry about money growing up?i am generally an anxious person, so i definitely worried about money growing up even though it was largely unwarranted. i always thought we didn't have much money because we were never allowed to get anything from the ice cream truck. turns out my parents were just frugal and didn't want us to waste money on overpriced spongebob pops with gumball eyes.do you worry about money now?i only have myself to take care of and i have a good emergency fund built up, so i don't worry so much about having money right now but i do worry a lot about how to manage my money and ensure i will have enough saved for the future.at what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?my parents paid for my tuition, room, and board through college and i was only responsible for my personal spending. since i graduated, i have been responsible for all of my expenses except for health insurance. i am still on my parent's health insurance since it doesn't cost them anything extra to include me in their policy. i pay for any health-related fees that are not covered by insurance. so i am not fully financially independent still, but once i turn 26 this summer, i will switch to my own health insurance through my job and be truly on my own. i know that if i had some kind of financial crisis, i could move back in with my parents and live in eternal shame, but they would be able to support me for as long as i needed.do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? if yes, please explain.my dad's parents started 529s for each of their grandkids and paid for one semester of my college, which was amazing. my parents also opened investment accounts for me that i found out about when i turned 21 (included in net worth above).day one6:45 a.m. — i stayed over at my boyfriend's apartment last night, so i get up and get ready (brush my teeth and wash my face with my boyfriend's neutrogena face wash) so that i can walk back home before work. my boyfriend, g., walks me halfway and then heads home. i listen to the daily during the rest of my walk.7:15 a.m. — i get back to my apartment and notice the toilet seat is up in the bathroom. g. almost never does that, so i immediately assume someone is in my apartment and get ready to dial 911 while dramatically whipping open the two closet doors that i have. luckily my apartment is very small so there are not a lot of places to hide, and i text g. to tell him that leaving the toilet seat up almost gave me a heart attack. i putz around until i work up the courage to start working.7:45 a.m. — i turn on my laptop and check my emails from the weekend. my company is pretty good at work/life balance, and i only have one message from my overzealous boss on friday night which is okay that i missed. i have some leftover chia pudding and then a bowl of cereal to start my day.1 p.m. — i love eating late lunch because it makes the afternoon feel shorter. i heat up some chorizo black bean soup that g. and i made over the weekend, adding fancy mexican blend shredded cheese from trader joe's and crushed up tortilla chips. i have no idea what makes the shredded cheese ""fancy"" but i am all for it. i eat at my little wfh desk and browse the internet instead of doing any work while i eat.5 p.m. — i have been really struggling to motivate myself at work for the last couple of months and i technically accomplished all that i absolutely need to today, so i turn off my laptop right at 5. earlier today i realized that i missed my parent's wedding anniversary over the weekend, so i give them a call while i go for a walk to stretch my legs. it was their 28th anniversary!6:30 p.m. — after i get back from my walk, i facetime my brother. we talk for a long time and catch up. i am very close with my brothers, but we are all terrible communicators so it's really nice to talk to him.8 p.m. — i call g. while i chop up a sweet potato into a sad imitation of potato chips and bake them in the oven. i munch on those ""chips,"" then heat up some more soup and throw in some leftover quinoa that i have. i eat while i catch up on this is us, my guilty pleasure show, and yes, i shed *several* tears.11:30 p.m. — i watch apartment tour youtube videos and look up and suddenly it's 11:30. i brush my teeth and hop in bed to read a couple of pages of the new jim crow. it is an incredible book and it feels like every page contains a statistic about mass incarceration so crazy that everyone in america should be panicking about it. but here i am, reading it several years after it came out and somehow being surprised by america's racial inequality. it is a really well-written book and i highly recommend it.daily total: $0day two7 a.m. — my alarm goes off on my smart speaker and starts playing the daily podcast while i begrudgingly get out of bed. when i crack the blinds, i see that it snowed last night! this improves my morning significantly because i love the snow, so i get ready quickly, transfer the podcast to my phone/headphones, and head out to stomp around in the snowfall before work.8 a.m. — the snow is absolutely glorious and i make some fresh tracks on the sidewalks around my neighborhood. i reaaaallllly miss skiing, where i normally get to enjoy the snow at its finest, but i am not going on any trips this year because of covid. snowy walks will have to do. i do some dishes that were crusting in my sink to put off working for a little while longer, then i open up my laptop.9 a.m. — i make some toast and slather it with almond butter to eat before my first meeting of the day. all of my calls are generally video calls, so i don't really eat on them. i have, however, let go of any other illusions of composure that i maintained when i was working in an office. my company has been remote since march 15 and i stopped wearing make-up and ""business"" clothes on march 16. today, i am rocking blue leggings and a black t-shirt i got for free in college. luckily, my team is 90% old men (hello technology industry) and they don't seem to notice.1 p.m. — i take a break from procrastinating my work to have lunch! quelle surprise, i heat up more chorizo black bean soup with fancy shredded cheese and quinoa. it is delicious and i have no regrets about this repeat meal cycle. i have some carrots too.4:20 p.m. — my big meeting is done and it was a minor conundrum rather than the major disaster that i was expecting. thrill of thrills! now that i am done with meetings, i decide to beat the evening rush and head to trader joe's.5 p.m. — there is no line at trader joe's, a pandemic miracle, and i take the long way home to walk through some more snow. i pick up cannellini beans, corn salsa, veggie burgers, frozen elote, garlic hummus, dried mango slices, a package of biodegradable sponges, broccoli, a cucumber, red bell peppers, a loaf of bread, tortillas, and more fancy shredded cheese ($41.58). after i put my groceries away, i sit down on the couch to get a little bit more work done. $41.586:30 p.m. — done with work and i change into exercise clothes. i am not an exercise person but i love lots of activities that require you to be in decent shape so here i am. i watch an episode of criminal minds while i work out to distract myself.7:45 p.m. — i chop up another sweet potato for fake chips and take a shower while they cook in the oven. it feels like bad oven safety to take a shower right now but it also feels efficient so here we are.8 p.m. — i start the new season of zoey's extraordinary playlist while i eat. i did not like the show at all when it first started but i got sucked in by the surprisingly raw emotion and now here i am shedding tears. i guess i'm having a sad tv show kind of week. i eat some more quinoa to supplement my paltry dinner and then a bowl of cereal because i'm not feeling like actually cooking.12 a.m. — after 20 minutes or so of reading, i turn off the lights and pretend i am asleep for an hour until i actually fall asleep.daily total: $41.58day three7 a.m. — the usual morning lineup. my alarm goes off and i listen to the daily while i slowly get ready for the day. i'm feeling a bit achy from my workout so i do some yoga to stretch out before i sit like a crumpled-up shrimp in my desk chair for the next eight hours.9 a.m. — i mix some frozen raspberries and chia seeds into greek yogurt with honey for breakfast, wait a few minutes for the chia seeds to get soft, and eat at my desk before the first meeting of the day starts. most of my work is independent, so i actually look forward to meetings to an extent because it means i get to interact with people and get feedback.12 p.m. — i am ravenous but i have a meeting starting in just a few minutes, so i eat a rice cake with almond butter to tide me over. luckily, my meeting ends early and i heat up the last of my leftover soup to enjoy for lunch. i'm glad this is the last of it because i am finally getting sick of eating the same thing.4:30 p.m. — morale is low. i have more work to do but i am not feeling it so i eat a pickle to motivate myself. i am able to focus for a little bit and i work for another 30 minutes.5:45 p.m. — i do a 30-minute workout from the nike app. they made the app free at the beginning of the pandemic and it is extremely helpful to me because i don't have to come up with exercises on my own. i watch criminal minds while i work out and once the episode is done i start cooking dinner. i throw some frozen falafel from trader joe's in the oven to warm up and then i chop up red onion, red pepper, and a cucumber. in my mind, this will all mix together into some sort of cucumber salad-type thing. unfortunately, the lid to my balsamic vinegar absolutely will not come off. i attack it with a corkscrew and just drill right through the metal top. i wouldn't say the end meal is especially authentic or delicious but it fills me up and that's what counts.8 p.m. — i jump in the shower after i eat dinner and then turn on the tv to watch outlander. i didn't leave my apartment at all today, which in normal times i would feel bad about, but since it's a pandemic, i guess i am just doing my civic duty. not all heroes wear capes.daily total: $0day four7 a.m. — my alarm goes off and i sit in bed for 10 minutes listening to the daily until i feel awake enough to start getting ready. it is 11 degrees outside today so i put on leggings and a thick pink sweater. i haven't turned my heat on because i get a decent amount of residual warmth from all of the apartments around me, but my apartment is 63° this morning and i need the bulky warmth of my sweater. i eat some toast with almond butter before logging on to work.12:30 p.m. — i ended up being on calls all morning, so i am glad to have a break. i have some leftover cucumber whatever-it-is mixture from yesterday, so i take the tape off the hole in the top of my balsamic vinegar bottle and pour some onto the veggies for my lunch.3 p.m. — i am actually being kind of productive this afternoon?? this is a pleasant development.6:45 p.m. — i've got a bug in my code that i can't work out, so i decide to call it quits for the night. i call my grandma to say hello. my grandpa passed away pretty unexpectedly two years ago and she has been really lonely, so my cousins and i each have a day of the week to call her. she tells me that she has an appointment to get the vaccine! this is a massive relief. while we chat, i pack a bag and head out to walk to g.'s where i will have dinner.8 p.m. — g. meets me a couple of blocks from his apartment and we walk the rest of the way together. my grandma is very concerned about me walking in the dark by myself and asks me before we hang up if g. will ""walk me home later tonight."" i lie and tell her that he will. i am actually sleeping over, but she doesn't need to know that. sorry, nana!10 p.m. — after having some lentil soup and watching two episodes of how to get away with murder, we climb into bed. he goes to bed so early all the time and i adapt to his schedule when we're together because i know it is healthier to get a full eight hours.daily total: $0day five6:45 a.m. — g. has fancy smart light bulbs that wake you up by slowly getting brighter and simulating the sunrise, and i love them. alarms are so harsh and sunrise is so gentle. we get up and get ready, then head out for a walk before work. the sun is coming up over the water and you can see a lot of the city skyline from the path, so i stop and take a picture. this is such a glorious way to start the day.8 a.m. — we return to g.'s apartment and have bowls of lucky charms for breakfast. i adore lucky charms. then we both sit down to work at his apartment.12 p.m. — i am technically done with work! our company started giving us half days on fridays when it became apparent that everyone was on the brink of losing their minds. i am beyond grateful and usually do take the full afternoon off. today, however, after a quick break for more lentil soup, i keep working because i have good momentum and also a new bug in my code to wrestle with. i taught myself python two years ago for my previous job, and i still feel like i have big gaps in my knowledge, but i really enjoy it and a pernicious bug is one of the few things that can get me to willingly work overtime.4 p.m. — i shake off my internalized capitalism and decide to stop working. g. is in grad school and has been working on homework most of the afternoon, but now that we're done, we decide to do a quick workout. before we work out, i mix the ingredients for pizza dough and start g.'s bread maker. we've been having pizza fridays for the last couple of months and i am a big fan.5:15 p.m. — workout is finished and we join a zoom call with some of our friends to play scattergories. we found a good online version and it's a fun way to burn a few hours. we have a few beers each, assemble our pizza and pop it in the oven, then once the zoom is done, we eat dinner and have some more beers.8 p.m. — i hop in the shower after dinner, g. showers after me, and then we turn on how to get away with murder. we are obsessed. my dad texts me that another snowstorm is expected to hit chicago tomorrow afternoon. classic dad weather report.11:30 p.m. — we tear ourselves away from htgawm so that we can go to sleep because, although we are on the edge of our seats, we are also tired.daily total: $0day six8 a.m. — i wake up sans-alarm but still earlier than i would like. g. wakes fully up and sits at his laptop to do some schoolwork, but i laze in bed and try to finish the nyt crossword from yesterday on my app. i make some good progress but i'm stuck on three clues! maddening.9 a.m. — g. makes toast and we each have two slices with butter and jelly for breakfast along with some yogurt and granola. i am dogsitting for my friend today, so while we eat, i check the balance of my ventra card. i load it with $10. $1010 a.m. — i convince g. to hang out at my friend's apartment while i dogsit, so we hop on a bus and i pay with my ventra card. once we arrive, we take the dog on a walk. i miss my childhood dog so much (he is a perfect angel and lives with my parents) so dogsitting is very welcome.11 a.m. — after we get back from our walk, the dog settles down for a snooze and we turn on htgawm, of course. g. places an order for panda express on uber eats. i venmo g. for my half. $232 p.m. — i take the dog up to my friend's roof where she can run around off the leash. she is an angel puppy and i throw her toys for her and generally have the time of my life.5 p.m. — g. and i take the dog on another walk after sitting around for a couple of hours. as promised in my dad's weather report, it has started snowing, so we have a great time marching about. we have enough leftover panda express for dinner, but i don't want to drink all of my friend's beer, so we close out our walk with a quick trip to the liquor store. the dog and i wait outside while g. goes in and grabs a six-pack of lagunitas hazy wonder. i venmo him for my half. $6.5011 p.m. — we take the dog on one last walk before heading back to g.'s apartment for the night. we can only leave her alone for eight hours or so overnight so i want to make sure she empties her tank, so to speak, before we leave. i love nothing more than late nights walks in quiet snow and i am truly so happy.12:30 a.m. — g. and i finally get a bus back home ($2.50 but i pay with my pre-loaded ventra card) and i run a quick load of laundry before we go to bed. my apartment building has paid laundry in the basement but g. has in-unit, so i do most of my laundry by cramming it into a backpack and walking it down to his apartment. it is extremely inefficient, but it is free so i'm all for it.daily total: $39.50day seven7 a.m. — my alarm goes off and i jolt awake. i hate alarms on weekends but that poor dog needs to go outside so i drag myself out of bed, grab my laundry out of the dryer, and head out the door. it feels too early to consider eating. there is so much snow outside that i have to wait in the road for the bus to come because the sidewalk is knee-deep. ($2.50 off my ventra card.)7:45 a.m. — i make it to my friend's apartment after trudging through quite a lot of snow. this is my first winter in chicago and it appears that they only plow the main roads. all the residential streets have over a foot of snow, and at this hour, they really haven't been shoveled at all. i walk in tire tracks down the middle of the road so that i can walk easily. the dog and i set out for an absolutely electric morning walk in which she poops not once, but twice, and dives headlong into the snowbanks every chance she gets. we are passed by a man who is cross-country skiing and i am thrilled with the whimsy of it all.9:30 a.m. — after returning from our walk i am extremely hungry. there is far too much snow to consider a quick walk somewhere for food, so i steal one of my friend's pepperidge farm bagels. this is a sign that i am truly desperate because as a native new yorker, i am a bagel snob. this affront to bagelry fills me up though, so i am grateful. the dog and i settle in to watch some tv and get warm again.11:30 p.m. — my friend texts me that he will be home by 3. in normal times, i'd wait around and see him, but since he's just been with a bunch of people, i want to head out before he gets back. the dog and i suit up for another walk. we see lots of kids sledding down a teeny tiny hill in a park. they are blissfully unaware that the hill is teeny tiny and i wish i had a sled myself.12:45 p.m. — i head out from my friend's to go back to g.'s apartment. i check the ventra app for updates and the next bus is 30 minutes away and i am sad. it's still snowing very hard and i make the most of my wait by constructing a miniature snowman next to the bus stop. i strongly consider going into walgreen's across the street to buy myself a snack, but i give myself the ""we have food at home"" talk and hold off.2 p.m. — i finally make it back to g.'s apartment and devour a lot of goldfish while i heat up some leftover pizza. we watch a couple of episodes of how to get away with murder while i eat and then decide to head out for a walk. it's been a big walking weekend, but the snow is gorgeous so it is worth it. we bundle up and walk down to the lake, which has frozen at the edges into huge floes of ice that are bobbing up and down in the waves. it is awesome and wild and fascinating.4:30 p.m. — we launch right into making dinner after our walk. g. and i have gotten very into somewhat absurdly early sunday dinners so that there's a long evening afterward where we can relax before work. we cook ground beef and potatoes as well as some rice and squash. g. went to the store this morning while i was at my friend's and bought all the ingredients, so i venmo him for my half. $156:30 p.m. — once dinner is all cleaned up, i decide to walk home. on the way, i call my other brother to catch up. as i walk and talk, i pass four cars stuck in the snowy unplowed roads and also an elaborately constructed igloo right on the sidewalk. it's extremely impressive and i love the effort.8 p.m. — finally i am home! i hop in the shower to warm the heck up and to get clean. then i grab a ricotta crumb bar, flop onto the couch, and watch two episodes of outlander. since i didn't get much sleep last night, i force myself to turn off the tv at 10:30 and climb into bed to read.daily total: $15"

annuallywas there an expectation for you to attend higher education? did you participate in any form of higher education? if yes, how did you pay for it?there was no expectation in my family to attend higher education. my parents are immigrants and they never had an opportunity to attend college and didn't have any opinions about it. despite this, i pursued a four-year university since it seemed like it was what you needed to do to get a good job. i ended up going to a private university and paid for it with loans, grants, and scholarships. i graduated with $17,000 in student loans which my mom and i both paid off. five years after i graduated i took out $13,000 in loans to go back to school to pursue a degree in a different field but i was forced to drop out after a semester for health reasons.growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? did your parent/guardian(s) educate you about finances?my parents never educated me about finances. my exposure to money centered around the mechanics of getting our bills paid like depositing money in the bank and writing checks to pay for bills. i learned how to do this to help my mom since her english wasn't good. not being educated about money definitely contributed to reckless spending habits which i have since worked hard to reform.what was your first job and why did you get it?my first job was in my family's restaurant. i was obligated to work there at a young age, but as i got older, i received a small wage for helping out. i used part of my wage to buy clothes and my mom squirreled away part of it as savings in a box in my dresser.did you worry about money growing up?yes, we were poor since we lived on meager restaurant paychecks and my father had a gambling addiction so more often than not we lost entire paychecks to it. he would also steal money from the rest of the family by going into our money hiding places in the house when we weren't home. we saved our money in cash at home rather than in a bank and in hindsight this was a very bad idea. this trauma taught me that we had serious money problems in our family and it was heartbreaking to process as a child. we relied on credit cards a lot to get by and kept our costs low by renting a too-small-for-us second floor of a two-family home for decades and never buying anything but essentials.do you worry about money now?yes, i worry a lot. our goal is to build our forever home on our land and the potential costs associated with it gives me a lot of anxiety. i'm also concerned about saving enough for retirement since we are so behind. i used to be a veterinary technician, but i stopped working a couple of years ago due to my declining health and i feel so useless not being able to contribute monetarily. every time i try to go back to work, i end up getting sicker so i have to constantly remind myself to accept it for what it is. i also remind myself that i contribute to our partnership by doing the cooking, cleaning, and managing of our finances/household but it's still hard to escape the self-loathing that comes from feeling like i'm not contributing enough. my health is also the main reason we are in such a poor position financially despite my husband's high salary. we spent almost all of our money on treatment, medicine, and doctor visits over an eight-year period, all of which were not covered by insurance. this was further exacerbated by living in a very hcol city for 10 years prior to moving to pennsylvania last year.at what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?i was more or less financially responsible for myself after college at 21 years old, with the exception of my mom assisting with some of my student loan payments and healthcare bills. i believe my in-laws would be our safety net if we really needed it.do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? if yes, please explain.last year, my mom cashed out my life insurance policy and wanted to apply the cash value of the policy to pay off the remainder of my student loans which totaled around $2,000. she also paid for some of my healthcare bills over a decade ago when i first got really sick which totaled around $1,000. i don't anticipate any future inheritance since my mom also cashed out her and my brother's life insurance policies and my family has zero assets.day one10:15 a.m. — alarm goes off. i groan because i hate mornings just like garfield. i usually don't set alarms to wake up but i'm going to get my second dose of the covid vaccine today. i toss on an old chambray shirt with shoulder cutouts for vaccine-accessible attire. grab a cardigan to wear over my shirt and take a couple of yes bars for easy road food for me and my husband, k.11:30 a.m. — i check in at the pharmacy and receive my second shot. i'm eligible in my state since i am immunocompromised. i haven't told anyone (besides family) i've gotten the vaccine because i don't want to feel obligated to explain my health history to them when they inevitably ask me how i'm eligible. the woman that gives me my shot comments on how prepared i am with my shirt and we both laugh.12 p.m. — k. drives us to home depot so i can return a plant. the plant is in great condition and grew so much while in my care but it's too high maintenance for me, which gives me anxiety. k. and i joked about how i fostered the plant and now it will get a forever home.12:50 p.m. — we get home and i start making us a very late breakfast. i'm making french toast with my homemade gluten-free sourdough bread with a side of eggs. we've been using this bread for everything since i cultivated my own starter earlier this month using bakerita's guide. doing the work of taking care of the starter is a million times worth it to get this quality of bread.1:10 p.m. — i'm about to plate our french toast when i get a call. it's the construction company we are working with to design and engineer our home. we discuss the changes to our contract due to the special circumstances of the build. the fee will be $4,000 higher than anticipated so we make sure we thoroughly go through any lingering concerns and questions. after we hang up, we finally gobble down our breakfast.3:20 p.m. — k.'s parents are in our neighborhood so they stop by to say hi. we meet them outside (masked) and take turns throwing the ball with our dog. we then go for a walk on the trails behind our townhouse and catch up. it's nice to see them because it's been so long since we had any social interaction. before they leave, we check out their new car. we're relieved they got it because their old car was really old and a bit of a safety hazard. after they leave, we commence our weekend netflix binge. we just started watching the sinner. we enjoy some snacks (cassava crackers and chocolate-covered almonds) and i take breaks occasionally to feed my sourdough starter and water my monstera.6:10 p.m. — my vaccinated arm is getting really sore and i can't lift my arm without it being in pain. k. volunteers to heat up leftovers for dinner. we have downshiftology's carrot ginger soup with my gluten-free sourdough rolls.7:20 p.m. — i donate $50 to aajc (asian americans advancing justice) after a family member makes a heartfelt post about her fears as an asian american. i've been wanting to write something to share since the atlanta shootings but i also wanted to give myself space to process all my feelings before i did. i start writing and in the end, i feel like it's exactly what i need to say. i decide to put up the post tomorrow as a fundraiser for aajc. $5010:30 p.m. — skincare routine before bed (marie veronique eo-free oil cleanser, thayer's toner, biossance vitamin c and rose oil, and acure rose argan oil followed with a gua sha facial massage). i apply yl progessence oil on my body and put on my ava fertility tracker bracelet (we've been trying to conceive for eight months so we are willing to try anything and everything at this point). i settle into bed for some nighttime scrolling and reading.11:20 p.m. — i'm unable to sleep since i'm starting to get some flu-like symptoms from the vaccine. the chills, headache, and body aches get progressively worse as the night wears on. i toss and turn till i finally fall asleep around 12:45 a.m.daily total: $50day two7:10 a.m. — i wake up to our dog and cats clamoring for breakfast. i'm still not feeling great so i force myself back to sleep while k. takes care of feeding them.10 a.m. — feeling slightly better so i wake up but decide to stay in bed. i take some tylenol while k. serves me avocado toast in bed. while i eat, i put up the fundraiser post for aajc i wrote yesterday. k. asks me to read him my post and we also read a piece by nicole chung called my white adoptive parents struggled to see me as korean, would they have understood my anger at the rise of anti-asian violence? it translates well for us as an interracial couple navigating these issues. i hope we can use the insights we learned to talk to his family about how to be better, more informed allies.11:15 a.m. — place an instacart order to be delivered later today. i order strawberries, spring mix, mushrooms, garlic, brown rice flour, red onion, lettuce, asparagus, eggs, and chicken. $68.862:20 p.m. — i order the items lingering in my thrive market cart to get the free gift that comes with placing an order today. i get coconut cream, arborio rice, apple sauce, psyllium husk, almond flour, and chocolate-covered almonds. i am weak for the free gifts and find myself ordering more often than i should. $51.455:35 p.m. — our instacart order arrives and k. starts wiping everything down while i rinse the produce and put everything away. i know covid is unlikely to spread through surfaces but we feel better staying vigilant about sanitizing our groceries.6:40 p.m. — i make pizza for dinner with homemade gluten-free sourdough pizza crust. finding this recipe was the best thing to happen to my taste buds this year — thank you to georgeats for the recipe. i haven't had good pizza since i had to restrict my diet for health reasons so i've missed pizza dearly. i can't eat dairy, gluten, refined sugars, soy, most meat (except for chicken and turkey), and i stay away from overly processed foods. if it weren't for my diet changes, my symptoms would flare up and debilitate me. i pop the par-baked crust in the cast iron pan and brush it with garlic oil. then i top the crust with vegan mozzarella, red pepper, mushrooms, kalamata olives, red onion, and pieces of chicken breast.8:15 p.m. — i'm getting slight cramps and can foresee another month of not being pregnant. this journey isn't easy especially on a day like today when i see multiple pregnancy announcements. although i'm truly happy for such wonderful news, i'm also sad for myself and it can be difficult to reconcile those conflicting feelings.10:50 p.m. — before heading to bed, i make a batch of sourdough to ferment for baking tomorrow as well as another batch of sourdough pizza crust dough. i do my nighttime routine and climb into bed. i watch some instagram stories and fall asleep around 2 a.m.daily total: $120.31day three11 a.m. — i wake up still not feeling well from getting the vaccine. however, i'm greeted by my dog eagerly waiting for me next to my bed. she runs to get her favorite toy to give me as a present and we play for a couple of minutes. she's such a mood-booster and i'm so grateful to have her in my life. i decide to check for any updates on what i posted yesterday and i get the warm fuzzies from all the support and love from my family and friends. we've raised almost $300 for aajc. my cat has migrated on top of me while i scrolled so i whisper sorry as i place her in another comfy spot so i can get up.11:35 a.m. — i get a call from our tax preparation office saying our return is ready to be submitted so i pay over the phone. i'm grateful we were able to get our taxes done with them remotely and eliminate any in-person interactions. $41511:50 a.m. — i make maple oatmeal with sautéed cinnamon apples for k. and me. i mix in some collagen peptides, sprinkle on hemp seeds and walnuts, and drizzle each bowl with a spoonful of nut butter. i take my vitamins and prep the ingredients for the sourdough bread while the oatmeal cooks.12:20 p.m. — i've been stalking vaccine appointments online for newly eligible family members that are having trouble getting an appointment. i was able to get appointments for almost all of my family members earlier this month so i am very familiar with this being an all-day endeavor. i can't imagine the elderly trying to navigate this difficult process.1:30 p.m. — i throw my sourdough into my kitchenaid mixer and shape my dough to rise for four hours. i also start mixing up the batter for sweet laurel bakery's strawberry shortcake recipe. by the time i finish making the strawberry sauce and coconut whipped cream, the cakes are ready to be pulled out of the oven.2:45 p.m. — we call to wish a happy birthday to k.'s dad. we decide to celebrate his birthday in person in three weeks after everyone who will be attending has had their vaccines plus two extra weeks for full effectiveness. even though we will be getting together in a well-ventilated covered porch and there will only be seven of us, we were adamant about waiting the full time for the vaccines to do their jobs. we had to cancel his birthday last year completely so i'm glad we were able to make it work this year.4:25 p.m. — i succumb yet again to the free gift and place another thrive market order for almond milk, olive oil, green goddess dressing, and maple syrup. $51.375:15 p.m. — it's a beautiful day so we take a walk outside and throw the ball with the dog. we love our townhouse complex because it's so quiet and as a bonus, we rarely see anyone out which makes us feel safer covid-wise. when we get back, i put the sourdough in the oven to bake and start dinner. i'm making veggiekins' cacio e pepe recipe with mushrooms and asparagus. we have strawberry shortcake for dessert and spend the rest of the night on netflix.10:40 p.m. — i do my usual bedtime routine and jot down my to-dos in my notes app on my phone for tomorrow. it's a habit that helps me from getting anxious about forgetting things which alleviates stress in the long run.11:10 p.m. — hello aunt flo. i climb back into bed feeling sad and defeated.daily total: $466.37day four11 a.m. — i woke up in the middle of the night last night to the bane of my existence, period cramps. they are abnormally terrible and have always been bad regardless of what i do. i quickly take more tylenol while i brace for them to return. my cat comes over to make biscuits on me. bless her for trying to comfort me.11:15 a.m. — i decide to quickly make some breakfast before my cramps take me down. i make us purely elizabeth collagen pancakes with a side of eggs. i put k.'s plate on a warm burner since he is currently on a work call.1 p.m. — i noticed we are running out of coq10 ubiquinol and order two bottles. we've been taking this to boost our fertility since last year and although the extra expense is not ideal, i'm willing to do anything to improve our chances of pregnancy. $71.981:45 p.m. — i get on a video call with my reproductive endocrinologist. it's my second visit with her and since we've just done all the testing this last month, she is going over the results. i found out a couple of weeks ago they saw something abnormal in my uterus so i have to have surgery. unfortunately, they don't have an opening for another three and a half months which means any treatment we want to do will have to wait until after. it's so disheartening to have to wait due to logistical issues. my re says we can do a trial of monitored clomid as a test run before surgery so i feel better we are doing something in the meantime. i'll be billed for this appointment in full after it gets bounced from my insurance since my plan does not cover infertility.2:30 p.m. — i take a pregnancy test so i can confirm to the nurse when she calls later that i'm not pregnant. upon confirmation, she calls in the clomid to the pharmacy for me.6:45 p.m. — i've been in bed the last four hours in pain. don't worry, this is normal for me. unfortunately, i still can't get up without doubling over so k. makes us green goddess salads with roasted almonds and garlic bread for dinner. he brings up a tray with my salad so i can eat in bed. i shower him with compliments on the delicious dinner.8:10 p.m. — i do my bedtime routine early and climb back into bed. i distract myself with season five of how to get away with murder for several hours. this show keeps getting crazier and crazier but i'm living for the insanity. after some doom scrolling, i fall asleep around 1:30 a.m.daily total: $71.98day five10:50 a.m. — i wake up and throw a load of laundry in the wash. i head down to the kitchen and make us chicken avocado lettuce wraps for a late breakfast. while i'm preparing the wraps, i preheat the oven so i can par-bake the sourdough pizza crusts. this recipe makes three crusts so i bake them one at a time in a cast iron pan. i wrap them up after they cool and put them in the freezer for future pizzas.12:40 p.m. — our sunbasket arrives and we rescue the box from the rain and put the meals in the fridge. we get the ingredients and recipes for three meals a week and it helps to reduce my stress about figuring out meals for dinner every single night. deducted already under monthly expenses.2:35 p.m. — i call the pharmacy to confirm my clomid is ready for pick up. i also pay for it over the phone so k. can do an easy curbside pickup later. my insurance doesn't cover this medication but the pharmacist works her magic and gets me a generous discount so it doesn't cost me over $30 for just five pills. i'm so thankful for her kindness. $9.334:05 p.m. — i order a bottle of ritual prenatals to replace my current prenatals. i've been taking my current ones for almost a year and it's way too expensive for not being pregnant. i've been researching alternatives for a while and heard good things about ritual so it'll be a good option while we are trying to conceive. i use a discount code to get 20% off. $284:30 p.m. — i get a zillow notification of new houses in my desired neighborhoods. i spend way too long browsing houses and dreaming about how much simpler it would be to buy a house instead. then i remember that the housing market is insane right now and nothing about this is simple so i mentally recommit to building our dream home instead.6:50 p.m. — k. texts me that he's starving while he is at the pharmacy so i get to work on dinner. we're having one of our sunbasket meals — turmeric pollock with tamarind green beans over spicy jalapeño rice. afterward, we have strawberry shortcake for dessert. we continue watching the sinner while we sip on our rooibos tea.9 p.m. — i order a cute little book called bunny's book club to send to my best friend's daughter for easter. i still haven't met her since she was born last year during the pandemic so i like to shower her with gifts instead. i think of my friend like a sister so i love her daughter as much as i would love my own. hopefully, it will be safe to travel soon so i can meet her in person. $13.6010:55 p.m. — i do my usual bedtime routine and get into bed. instead of doing any actual sleeping, i end up scrolling instagram and facebook. i really need to do a social media detox again.daily total: $50.93day six10:40 a.m. — it's a new month and although the last couple days were definitely a bit of a rollercoaster for my body, i'm happy to wake up in good spirits. it's national poetry month so i find a beautiful poem by robert hass called iowa city: early april and publish it on my personal online journal. for years, i've collected and added my favorite poetry to this journal. it's for me to read and reread and i can only assume every once in a while someone stumbles upon it, and i hope whoever they are, they stay to enjoy the poetry.11:30 a.m. — i head to the kitchen to make blueberry coconut oatmeal for k. and me. i also make a new batch of my seed cycling mix (flaxseed and pumpkin seed) in my vitamix. i mix the seed cycle powder into my oatmeal and take my first dose of clomid.1:35 p.m. — i water my plants and lament about the scorched leaves on my pin-stripe calathea. i really hope it does better because i love the pretty pale pink stripes on the leaves. i do a few other household chores while i'm in clean-up mode. i also unpack and put away our thrive market orders that have been accumulating by our door. we let our packages sit for a couple days to decontaminate. we're probably being overly cautious, but i figure it doesn't hurt so we do it just in case.3 p.m. — my arm feels back to normal so i can finally do some yoga. i do a 30-minute power vinyasa flow from alo yoga's youtube channel. my dog joins me for a sphinx pose but then gets too excited so k. has to call her away so i can finish my workout. when i'm done, i clean the bathroom and hop in for a quick shower.4:25 p.m. — i prep and cook a big batch of rosemary chicken and veggies for k. to eat for lunches for the upcoming week. i also bake chocolate cake doughnuts. after they cool, i dip them in a caramel glaze, sprinkle them with maldon sea salt flakes, and place them in the fridge to set. at this point, i realize i've spent so long in the kitchen that it's almost dinner time. i start making another sunbasket meal for dinner. tonight we're having huli huli chicken with a pineapple slaw.7:10 p.m. — we have the chocolate doughnuts i baked earlier for dessert with some honeybush tea. then we spend the rest of the night snuggled up on the couch watching the sinner.11:25 p.m. — crawl into bed after my usual nighttime routine. i spend my after-bedtime personal time reading poems on my laptop in the dark while k. sleeps. after a while, i notice it's almost 2:30 a.m. and decide to put the laptop away and go to sleep.daily total: $0day seven10:35 a.m. — i wake up and post another new poem on my journal for today. i realized yesterday i didn't have one of my favorite mary oliver poems posted yet so i publish a pretty song to my journal. rest in peace, mary.11 a.m. — i realize i forgot to watch the new law & order: svu last night. i've never been this excited about tv but it's the long-awaited return of elliot stabler. but first, breakfast. i make apple cinnamon oatmeal again. i leave k.'s bowl on a burner to stay warm since he's on a work call and start watching with my oatmeal in hand #teambensler.1:40 p.m. — that cliffhanger. while i was watching the show, i noticed that k.'s paycheck didn't come through today. it turns out they have a payroll issue so we opt to wait until his next paycheck to receive what we're owed. it's slightly annoying but since there's nothing we can do about it, i pull up our budget spreadsheet and shift some things around to make sure this hiccup won't cause any issues.4 p.m. — we go for a walk and play ball with the dog before it gets dark. we discuss how melancholy i am about this whole pregnancy thing. i was triggered earlier when i saw another pregnancy announcement so i've been a bit mopey all day. i'm having such a tough time because it's supposed to be joyous news and i hate myself for being so upset. i feel so alone but i'm clinging to hope that the clomid i'm taking will be a gamechanger for us.7 p.m. — another sunbasket meal for dinner tonight. i make lemongrass chicken lettuce cups for us and we watch the falcon and the winter soldier on disney+ while we eat. we have chocolate doughnuts for dessert with peppermint tea.11:30 p.m. — i place some items in my instacart basket for an order i'll make tomorrow. i get ingredients to make carrot cake for easter this weekend as well as our usual groceries. we won't be getting together with family for easter this year, but i'd like to make the cake so k. can enjoy it since it's his favorite dessert. i do my nighttime routine and scroll through zillow, check on my neopets, and read a little until i fall asleep.daily total: $0"

did you participate in any form of higher education? if yes, how did you pay for it?my parents did not go to college but it was always expected that i would. i decided when i was 15 that i wanted to be a lawyer and have been working toward that goal since then. i've always loved school from a young age and wish i could have stayed in academia forever! i was lucky enough to get a full-ride scholarship to law school and only took out $3,000 for books and other expenses. i went to a state school for undergrad and graduated in three years. i received a few scholarships and the rest was split between my parents and myself. i had approximately $25,000 in debt after school.growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? did your parent/guardian(s) educate you about finances?i don't remember many conversations about money growing up! my parents are still very much of the view that it is ""impolite"" to talk to about finances.what was your first job and why did you get it?my first job was as a camp counselor. i made $300 for the entire summer and used it to buy an ipod nano. i worked a variety of odd jobs through college and law school, but the money was always used as extra spending money. my first ""real"" job is the job i have now.did you worry about money growing up?yes and no. i am so, so fortunate to have grown up in a very stable home. i always felt secure in the sense that i knew i would have a roof over my head and food in my belly. i also am very fortunate to have a large extended family who would have never let us truly struggle. however, i had a lot of medical problems growing up and was always acutely aware of our medical debt. there was always a pit in my stomach when we received a hospital or doctor bill. even though my parents have pretty good insurance, i know they have accrued a lot of medical debt on my behalf.do you worry about money now?again, yes and no. i am obviously very comfortable right now and it would be insincere to pretend i wasn't. that being said, i do have chronic health conditions and am always very aware of the fact that i could lose everything to a medical emergency. there is really no telling what the future holds and i think it would be naive to stop worrying about money now just because i'm currently in a good financial position.at what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?i guess this is up for debate, right? i would say when i graduated law school at 24 and moved into my own apartment in manhattan and was completely financially responsible. i still pay for everything myself obviously, but i'm living with my parents at a highly subsidized rate. so, you let me know! am i financially responsible for myself? i think it's clear i have a financial safety net with my parents. however, i want to emphasize that i didn't move back in with them for the sole purpose of saving money. my parents are genuinely the best people i know and i love living with them! i cried like a baby when i initially moved out a few years ago and am pretty happy to be back with them!do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? if yes, please explain.no.day one9:30 a.m. — ah, it's saturday! despite this, i wake up to five work emails that all need my immediate attention. i log on to my computer and try to squeeze in as much work as possible. i pause in the middle for a few rounds of fetch with my dog.11:30 a.m. — it looks like it's going to be a working weekend but nothing can bring me down because today, i get vaccinated!! my parents and i have appointments this afternoon — they are eligible based on their jobs and i am eligible because of my health conditions. i get dressed, eat a granola bar, and head out the door with my parents.1:30 p.m. — we're done! the vaccinations went smoothly, and i am so, so grateful for the scientists who were able to produce this in less than a year! i am almost on the verge of tears thinking about how it will be safe to hang out with my friends and family again. i text my grandma and tell her i can't wait to be able to see her again.3 p.m. — i'm finally back home after sitting in a lot of traffic and begrudgingly accept the fact that i'm going to have to work most of the day. i haven't eaten a real meal yet today so i order my favorite chicken parm from a local restaurant ($42.24 with tip). i sadly eat this at my desk while answering emails. $42.2411 p.m. — i can't believe i've been sitting at my desk for this long. i decide to call it quits for the night and do my nightly routine (bothering my sleeping dog, washing my face, and scrolling through tiktok) until i finally fall asleep around 1 a.m.daily total: $42.24day two10 a.m. — i wake up and do a quick check to see if i'm feeling feverish or sore from the vaccine — nope! thank god, because i could hear my phone dinging throughout the night and know this is going to be another busy workday. my dad bought bagels so i eat one before joining an hour-long conference call.1 p.m. — it's so beautiful out and i've already put in three hours of work today so i decided it is time to get out of the house. i borrow my dad's car and go on a drive, stopping to get french fries and a soda on the way ($8.72). i don't really need to stop by any stores and don't want to unnecessarily risk exposure to covid, so i head home after an hour and a half. again, i can't wait to be fully vaccinated. $8.723 p.m. — you guessed it, i'm working. a few of my deals are blowing up and all need my immediate attention. i join calls, send emails, and review documents for the next few hours. it isn't glamorous but i do find the work somewhat interesting at least. after a few hours, i take a break to chat with my sister and heat up yesterday's leftovers for dinner.10:30 p.m. — i physically cannot work anymore and decide to log off for the night (although i answer a few more emails on my phone). my skin has been soooo bad lately (probably the stress) so i browse skincare on sephora but don't end up buying anything. i also browse bloomingdales before realizing i don't actually need anything and am just trying to shop as stress relief. i turn on an episode of it's always sunny in philadelphia and try to fall asleep.daily total: $8.72day three7 a.m. — nope. i can't wake up at this time.8:30 a.m. — i also cannot wake up at this time, but my email notifications keep going off so i wake up anyway. there is a shitstorm in my inbox and i buckle down for another long day. i forgo breakfast and get to work.12:30 p.m. — predictably, i am starving! every week i tell myself i am going to stop ordering lunch and every week i break that promise to myself. sorry, self. i order a chicken sandwich and allow myself a generous ten minutes to scroll through social media. $15.725 p.m. — i have a few more projects that i desperately need to get to tonight. i spend the remainder of my evening juggling those projects and the never-ending emails. there are, of course, a few breaks to pet my dog and scroll through social media. at some point, i surface from my room and head to the kitchen to grab leftovers. i see my mom bought cadbury eggs so i obviously take a generous handful of those as well. i know a lot of people my age would hate living with their parents, but do they have cadbury eggs magically appear in their kitchen? i think not!11:30 p.m. — logging off!daily total: $15.72day four8 a.m. — this time, i actually get out of bed. i have a few meetings today (thankfully none on zoom!) so i spend the morning preparing for those. i miss getting ready for work each day but it is honestly such a timesaver to not have to do my hair and makeup on a daily basis.10 a.m. — my mom's birthday is later this week and i'm concerned part of her birthday gift won't arrive on time. a few weeks ago, i ordered her a pair of diamond earrings that i really hope she loves. my absolute favorite part of having money is buying gifts. if you're a believer in love languages, mine is definitely gift-giving. i browse a few different flower delivery services before ultimately settling on the classic, 1-800-flowers, and arrange for the flowers to be delivered to her work in a few days. $70.5211 a.m. — my dog is going absolutely batshit crazy, so i can tell we had packages delivered. as luck would have it, my mom's earrings arrived today. they are gorgeous! a bit smaller than i expected, but still a great gift (in my humble opinion). i'm super excited for the second package i receive — a bag i ordered from an instagram ad. i was a bit skeptical when placing the order but i love it in person and am very pleased with my purchase. can't wait until it's safe to actually go out again and show this bad boy off. (for inquiring minds, the earrings were $144 and the bag was $77, but i paid for both of these items weeks ago.)1 p.m. — my sister comes home from work early and we decide that we are in the mood for pizza. i give her $20 to go pick it up and let her keep the change. by the time she gets home with the pizza, i'm stuck on a really tense call with a client (where i am thankfully mostly an observer) and can't get to my pizza until an hour later. booooo. it's cold but it's still pizza, so i won't complain too much. $206:30 p.m. — my mom texts me to let me know she made dinner. i thankfully have a lull in workflow and actually sit down at the table to eat with my family! i eat most meals at my desk so i'm grateful for any opportunity i have to enjoy a meal across from a person and not a computer screen. we mostly chat about my dog's birthday, which is tomorrow. we're all set with his presents and his special doggie cake.7:00 p.m. — in the words of hannah montana, ""back to the computer...i'm such a nerd!"" i spend the rest of my night reviewing contracts and responding to emails. my to-do list keeps getting longer and longer and i genuinely don't know how i'm going to get this work done.12:30 a.m. — i didn't accomplish all that i wanted to tonight but my body is screaming for sleep and i have to listen. goodnight!daily total: $90.52day five8:45 a.m. — roll out of bed and take the scenic route (aka stop by the kitchen to grab breakfast) to the office today. it's my pup's birthday today so i spend a few minutes playing with him and holding back tears at the thought of him getting older. i truly cannot live without him.1 p.m. — meetings, meetings, and more meetings today. unlike the motto ""this meeting could've been an email,"" these meetings were all pretty productive and helped move projects along. however, they are a huge time suck and i'm very behind on other projects. i heat up a frozen meal for lunch and continue on with my day.2 p.m. — i'm obviously approaching burnout because i just sent an email to three partners with a really stupid typo. they caught it right away and asked me to fix it. i feel incompetent and embarrassed.6 p.m. — my parents and sister congregate in my room to discuss dinner plans and we end up deciding on pizza. i treat ($24.05). the pizza comes an hour later, and after we eat it, we sing happy birthday to the dog and give him his presents. he loves his assortment of bones and toys and falls asleep early from the excitement! $24.057:30 p.m. — i'm still stewing about my stupid typo but i really need to brush it off. work on various projects, answer emails, you know the drill.11:30 p.m. — i log off for the night and watch an episode of law & order: svu before falling asleep.daily total: $24.05day six8 a.m. — we are approaching the end of the week!! the past few weeks have been busier than usual and i'm dying for the weekend. i've been neglecting the group chat with my college friends and send everyone a good morning message. we chat about post-pandemic plans. god, i can't wait to see people my own age again!12 p.m. — uber eats is calling my name and i must answer...i order burger king. their new spicy chicken sandwich is amazing. $17.425 p.m. — my mom gets home from work so i take a break from emails and chat with her about her day. it gets lonely being cooped up in this house alone all day!7 p.m. — my mom makes pasta for dinner which is delicious as always. i make it 15 minutes at the dinner table before needing to run back to my computer to answer urgent emails.9 p.m. — i hear my mom watching bravo and can't resist...i fit in an episode of summer house (luke sucks) before heading back to work.1:30 a.m. — omg. the work just does not stop coming and i want to be able to get as much done before the weekend so i stay up getting shit done.daily total: $17.42day seven7:30 a.m. — it's friday and it's 70 degrees! i have a few back-to-back calls this morning so i grab a water bottle and granola bar and settle in at my desk.11:45 a.m. — obviously that granola bar did not cut it because my stomach is rumbling. screw it, i'm ordering a big lunch. bring on the wings and fries! $36.363 p.m. — take a break to listen to taylor swift's new song. it's good, but it's no folklore/evermore. happy for her that she's living her best life though!6:30 p.m. — family dinner! my parents order chinese. i don't pay, we try to alternate paying for dinners out.8 p.m. — i have a $25 gift card to bloomingdale's that is burning a hole in my pocket. i debate between using it for a bigger purchase like a david yurman ring or a smaller purchase. i end up ordering hourglass mascara that i've heard good things about. it comes to $6.50 with tax. $6.5010:30 p.m. — i log on for another few hours of work. it is kind of nice working when things are quiet, i'm much more productive when i'm not being flooded with emails. i listen to taylor swift's new song again and decide i love it now.daily total: $42.86"

covered by my companycell phone: $40was there an expectation for you to attend higher education? did you participate in any form of higher education? if yes, how did you pay for it?yes. both my parents are college-educated immigrants, so there was no question about the need to attend higher education. my parents paid for my undergraduate degree and i got one or two scholarships. i took out federal loans for grad school.growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? did your parent/guardian(s) educate you about finances?my parents grew up in relative poverty, so they always reinforced the importance of education in pursuit of a stable career that wouldn't break down my body. the basic rules around finances were: always pay off your credit card in full, never owe anyone money, make sure you have a good credit score. don't buy what you can get for free. don't be an artist because you'll starve. you need to make enough to be comfortable sending any children you have to college.what was your first job and why did you get it?in high school, i tutored elementary school students and taught piano in order to have spending money. my parents didn't provide an allowance or pay for peer-related activities, so if i wanted to go to prom or participate in school sports, i had to earn the money myself. i usually borrowed sports uniforms and prom dresses from friends. my parents also seldom bought me things that weren't necessities, so my clothes and toys were generally secondhand church donations or gifts from family friends.did you worry about money growing up?no. i grew up in an affluent community of h1b visa immigrants and my parents provided me every educational/extracurricular opportunity available. it sometimes made me uncomfortable to not be able to go out with friends or fit in on the basis of our belongings, but i never worried about basic needs.do you worry about money now?thinking about my student loans knocks the breath out of me. however, i'm four and a half verified years into a 10-year public service loan forgiveness, so i cross my fingers that the government doesn't eliminate loan forgiveness plans and try not to dwell. i did worry about money a lot between the ages of 21-27 when i moved to an economically recessed state where i was chronically underemployed. i lowkey think everyone should have the experience of working two jobs at once. i also did americorps for a year (which pays an annual salary of $12,000), which was rewarding but not the easiest, financially. getting fast food was a big deal.at what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?i became financially responsible for myself at age 21 when i graduated from college. that being said, i will always have the financial safety net of my parents and older sister, who would support me if i fell on a hard place. when i think about the financial decisions i've made in life (doing public service work, taking out student loans), i know i've had the immense privilege of making them with relative ease and comfort, knowing that my family would never let me be homeless (though they have let me be on food stamps).do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? if yes, please explain.when i was in college, my mom gave me her ford escort station wagon, which i drove into the ground. when i was moving back to california several years ago, i asked my parents to loan me $2,000 to cover moving expenses. i paid them back over a year and a half, but they then gave me $800 for christmas, so in essence, i only paid them back $1,200. once a year, my parents will give me a red envelope for a holiday or my birthday, which usually contains $400-$800.day one7:50 a.m. — per usual, i roll out of bed less than 45 minutes before i have to be at work. beauty routine: brush hair. i recently purchased a (drybar super lemon drop) hairbrush for the first time in my life after my free brushes lost their bristles; it's revolutionized my hair brushing game. wash my face with a probiotic mangosteen cleanser and put on a blazer so that my top half is presentable in court. pair with a frnch sheer polka-dotted top (thrifted), ag high-rise ankle jeans (not thrifted), and robert clergerie oxfords (thrifted). a silver lining about masking in public (in addition to the public health benefits) is that i no longer have to apply makeup because no one can see my face anyway.8:30 a.m. — arrive at work, make coffee, grab a handful of hard candies, and hop on a four-hour video conference with one of the collaborative courts my team co-founded. discuss individual cases of clients involved in restorative justice and rehabilitative programs within the criminal justice system. court commences and the judge calls clients up to the stand one by one. i know you're not supposed to have favorites, but one of my fave chronically homeless clients just found permanent housing and his cheek-to-cheek smile is killing me.2 p.m. — it's a great day in that i'm flying through tasks and don't have much time to contemplate my existence, let alone break to eat lunch. i place a doordash order for four acai bowls — one to eat, three to freeze. i think this will be cost-effective except that i proceed to eat two of them. feck. $46.634:30 p.m. — i get a center-wide email informing me that there is leftover catering — oven-baked chicken, collard greens, cornbread, and mac and cheese. i grab two boxed lunches for tomorrow.5:20 p.m. — drop by a client's apartment to make sure he's okay because he missed an appointment with me this afternoon. he's fine, just had a spell of deep anxiety. i feel that. we reschedule.6:30 p.m. — head over to my boyfriend, t.'s, apartment and order ethiopian food for dinner — two veggie combos and a bunch of injera. we watch minari (which he pays for) and then i stay up an extra hour googling everything about the director, lee isaac chung, and wondering how such a gem of a human came into being. $43.44daily total: $90.07day two9 a.m. — t. makes tea for two while i slowly wake up. we head out toward the farmer's market, stopping by blue bottle first. i order a cappuccino with oat milk ($5 with tip). at the market, we grab lettuce, radishes, cabbage, fresh pasta, empanadas, lemons, and popcorn. as per usual, t. buys most of the groceries and i buy him flowers for his place. last week it was fuzzy puffs of bright green dianthus; this week, it's tulips splashed with orange and yellow ($10). i love the small luxury of buying flowers, which simultaneously necessitates an acceptance of the ephemeral. $1512 p.m. — we walk to the lake to eat our empanadas and soak in some sun, then return home to eat our lunch boxes. my cat joins us when he smells the chicken.3:30 p.m. — seduce t. by taking off my clothes and walking into the living room, where he is reading, and loudly announcing that he is officially the only one in the house with clothes on. it works. we give each other massages and get intimate, which is great for my mental health and skin. i'm neurotic about a lot of things, but sex for me is a completely enjoyable activity where i feel in the moment and grounded in my body. also doesn't hurt that we discovered this divine massage candle (maude) that melts into your skin and makes you smell like a fancy cookie. you can stop reading this and go order it now. i'll wait.6:30 p.m. — dinner is tea leaf salad and farmer's market meyer lemon pappardelle. i've been really getting into burmese tea leaf salads since i discovered that you can buy a diy kit and then call yourself a person who eats salad.8 p.m. — we watch another lee isaac chung movie, munyurangabo, which is free to stream. also so good. i am infatuated with this director.daily total: $15day three8 a.m. — wake up, read the internet. t. makes us tea, i make us fried egg, avocado, and veggie breakfast sandwiches.11 a.m. — t. is an introvert and i know he'd enjoy some time alone to read/workout/play music/take a work call, so i go out for a walk. i normally do this while listening to an audiobook, but i still have too many thoughts rolling around in my head from last night's movie, so i put on music instead.11:30 a.m. — order a starbucks grande soy caramel macchiato (free, with my star rewards) and head to the lake. choose a patch of grass, smoke a joint, draw, listen to ken liu's the hidden girl and other stories (he blows my mind even when i'm not high), and do some yoga (also normally self-conscious about this, except when stoned. highly endorse stoned yoga).1 p.m. — next goal is to find some succulents for t.'s outdoor planter, which was decimated by a recent windstorm. walk to my favorite flower shop which has a meh array of succulents this week. trader joe's and whole foods are rocking echeveria and not much else. decide to visit the sf flower market next week instead. walk to a bakery, where i get a morning bun for myself, a corn cherry scone for t., plus a half dozen english muffins ($10.50). i finish off the morning bun by the time i'm at the lake again, and i still want more carbs, so i ask for a jollof rice and diet coke at the liberian food truck. they only have regular coke. oh. i know they'll have diet coke at the food truck with the bougie tacos, so i get it there ($9.80). $20.302 p.m. — dear diary, jollof rice and diet coke was such a good decision.2:15 p.m. — glance at my phone. no texts from t. doesn't he miss me yet?? i walk to whole foods to get some staples: marshmallows (i finished a bag last night while watching munyurangabo), kombucha, chocolate, orange sorbets, and spiced chickpeas to put on future salads ($26.27). considering how amazon treats its workers, i feel bad supporting it by purchasing groceries through whole foods/having a prime membership, and i'm still figuring out how to balance my personal values against the cost of cognitive/emotional labor. real talk, i'm just not ready to give up how easy amazon makes my life. making these choices sometimes feels like a game you can't win. $26.273 p.m. — t. texts me with an update about my cat. i am pleased.4 p.m. — home, sex, shower, dinner (mushroom ravioli and tea leaf salad). run the dishwasher, (does anyone else love the sound of a running dishwasher? … no? yeah, me neither), snuggle on the couch, and read until bedtime. i get the number of browser tabs on my phone from 42 down to 19.7 p.m. — a client number shows up on my caller id, but no voicemail is left. acknowledging that my client's lives don't end at 5 p.m., i tell them that they may email/call me and leave a message. i'll get back to them if it's an emergency; otherwise, i'll talk to them during normal business hours. this client was doing well on friday, so i will leave it until tomorrow.10:30 p.m. — my cat and i are falling asleep on t., so we go to bed.daily total: $46.57day four7:30 a.m. — t. wakes me up with a mug of drinking chocolate. this is an acceptable reason to get out of bed. splash my face with cold water to wake myself up. my eyebags are insane, i need to get more kiehl's midnight eye cream, that or take out my contacts once in a while.8:10 a.m. — work from home day. i head home and gas up my scooter along the way ($3.79). bridge toll to get back into the city is $3. read emails, quick team meeting, browse news/research articles relevant to my field, provide 1-1 supervision, sit in on a training, and make a few calls. $6.7912:30 p.m. — lunch. i have two nespressos, arugula, avocado, and goat cheese salad with whole wheat bread, and two tangerines. place a grocery order for delivery ($172.80) and remind myself that no matter how much money i spend on groceries, it's still cheaper than doordash takeout, which i am ashamed to say i got six times last week (it was a week in which my housemates and i moved apartments, but still). $172.801 p.m. — give myself a bang trim. i've done better and also worse. i would pay $0 for this trim which is exactly how much i paid, so i'm satisfied.2 p.m. — finish up performance evaluations for staff and schedule meetings with them to go over the evals. email hr to see if we can get merit raises for exemplary team members. not in our budget this year. such is life in the public sector.5 p.m. — snack on frozen peach slices. but in the shower. the contrast of hot water and icy fruit is a refreshing treat.5:30 p.m. — unearth a trader joe's margherita pizza from the freezer. one of my housemates is lactose intolerant and the other is allergic to gluten, so this must have been left by a previous housemate. i assume i'm doing them a favor by liberating them of this pizza. oh god, this expired in november 2017. on the other hand, frozen food does not expire and the longer i contemplate the date, the more it feels like a challenge, so it's on. read work emails while pizza bakes.5:50 p.m. — this pizza is delicious?! the cheese to sauce ratio is excellent, and it has the umami delightfulness of a bagel bite. also, free. crust is a little stale (unsure if it would've been drastically different in 2017) but that can be remedied with a brush of olive oil. i top the pizza with homegrown basil leaves. i also have a glass of sparkling water with ginger syrup from my soda stream. a housemate purchased this for me after watching me dispatch a 12-pack of sparkling water in roughly three days.7:30 p.m. — we are still not fully moved into our new place, so i accompany my housemates to our old apartment, help disassemble their wardrobes and haul them over. omg, i just realized that i forgot a load of laundry in the washer over the weekend and it smells terrible. cool, no one noticed. rewash laundry.daily total: $179.59day five7:40 a.m. — slept terribly because i'm an idiot and kept a paper-wrapped pillar candle burning through the night, and the crackling of burning paper woke me up at 2 a.m. by now you've probably deduced that i use all my energy to pull myself together and appear competent at work. on the other hand, i don't want to short-sell myself. i'm the youngest manager to be hired in my organization, ever. #notsohumblebrag8:30 a.m. — breakfast at my desk consists of coffee and a chocolate mint protein bar, carefully selected from my drawer of non-perishable foods. everyone knows that my office is an open stockroom of snacks and fixer-uppers (dry shampoo, makeup/facial wipes, ibuprofen, etc.). start working through emails, oversee client drop-ins, review referrals, provide 1-1 supervision, take a zoom call.12:45 p.m. — lunch! i've been looking forward to this since friday — defrost an acai bowl and polish it off. i eyeball the other bowl but leave it alone. have a leftover cobb salad instead.1:15 p.m. — my coworker is taking candy orders for her grandson's preschool fundraiser. philanthropic candy purchase? shut up and take my money. i purchase a box of see's candies assorted lollipops. spend the rest of the day training a new employee and going over client assignments with staff. $22.505:30 p.m. — masked, socially distant hang out with my friend at the park. i run home to grab a bunch of snacks (crackers, cheese, raw veggies, guacamole, beer) for a picnic. she brings lawn chairs, bakery dim sum, and roasted spaghetti squash with homemade tomato sauce for me to have for lunch tomorrow. a keeper, obviously. we talk for four hours straight and watch the sunset.daily total: $22.50day six8:30 a.m. — wfh day. wake up late with a headache and hop onto a zoom call with the camera off because my eye bags have eye bags and my hair is all over the place.9:30 a.m. — shower, have a nespresso and banana, followed by client teletherapy sessions and supervision. water all my plants in between calls. why is my monstera philodendron browning at the edges? please send thoughts and prayers.2 p.m. — lunch is kitchari with green harissa and my friend's spaghetti squash. also, another nespresso. someone baked my housemate a batch of gluten-free chocolate chip cookies. i snatch one.3 p.m. — team meeting for the rest of the day.5:30 p.m. — make a shared house dinner of tea leaf salad and cioppino with salmon and shrimp, another freezer find left behind by a previous housemate. listen to immunity by eula biss while cooking. send silent gratitude to the housemate who departed without their frozen seafood. should really send out a thank you card at this rate.7 p.m. — text t. to figure out hangout plans using communication skills learned in couples' therapy last week. we both have some trauma from past relationships, plus different attachment styles informed by our upbringing, so we're doing what we call preventative couples' therapy. practicing communication feels a lil awkward because it's not organic, but the fact that we are both invested in building our relationship infuses me with a warm feeling. t. also texts me a photo update of my cat, which is 100% my preferred love language.8 p.m. — unbox more, smoke a joint, and dance around my room. i used to do work exchange at a dance company, but when life gives you a pandemic… read a few pages of lacan. stoned reading is just behind stoned yoga in terms of entertainment value.10 p.m. — late night snack: honey ginger tea, sugar snap peas, hummus, and crackers. also my housemate's leftover dahl and peanut butter and raspberry jam. maybe getting high right before bed is not the best idea.daily total: $0day seven7:30 a.m. — wake up with a stomach ache. down a nespresso and wash my bangs with a bit of dish soap in the kitchen sink since my housemate is showering. throw on levi's (thrifted), a rag & bone tank top (thrifted), olive utility jacket (thrifted), and clover green converses (not thrifted; shoutout to our madame vp!). my housemate texts me to remember my lunch. amazingly, i had remembered to get it out of the fridge before the text. i am a goddess.8 a.m. — head to work where i dive into phone calls, followed by a three-hour stakeholder meeting. have a coffee and banana while i'm working. order my client who was recently released from jail an aromatherapy diffuser as a housewarming gift ($22.45, expensed).1 p.m. — half-hour break between meetings. make more coffee and eat my lunch (kale/arugula salad with sprouts, radishes, cranberry chutney, nuts, seeds, and green goddess dressing). venmo my housemate for his costco run of shared household items (toilet paper, dish detergent, hummus, peanut butter, frozen fruit, greek yogurt, cheese, bananas, avocados, tangerines) plus some items i asked him to specifically pick up for me — matcha powder, nespresso pods, tofu, non-dairy milk, canned fish. $844:50 p.m. — my friend texts to say she is starting a reading group focused around the book pleasure activism by adrienne maree brown and asks if i want to join. yes! she encourages me to purchase brown's novel from a local bookstore. i only ever need half a reason to make my way to a bookstore, so i put directions into my map and head out. driving out of the city on my scooter makes the receding city skyline look like a little jeweled toy box. as a social worker, i tend to see my city's ailments and heartbreaks on the daily, so zooming out (literally) for a bird's eye view is a sweet break. smell ya later, sf!5:45 p.m. — hello, new books. walk out of the store with the prescribed book ($20) and a used copy of the emperor of water clocks by yusef komunyakaa ($9). i also get a pencil that simply says john waters on it ($2). haaa. i have store credit from when i previously sold a batch of books, so the grand total is $0.6:30 p.m. — head to t.'s apartment. my stomach is still grumbly, so i make myself congee for dinner and (surprise) a tea leaf salad for t. to eat with his leftover curry. he surprises me in return with a few presents (a black currant & bergamot scented candle and a glass carafe because i have, for the past few months, been placing expensive candles and gorgeous water carafes in online carts and then abandoning them in cyberspace). bah, what a sweetie.8:30 p.m. — slow melting into the couch to read and serve as a pillow for my cat, who plops himself between us. with the city lights winking outside and the dishwasher running, it's my favorite time of day.daily total: $84"

did you participate in any form of higher education? if yes, how did you pay for it?kind of? of the three of us siblings, i was ""the smart one"" so it was assumed, but the only pressure was to do it as cost-effectively as possible. for undergrad, i ended up at a really good local state school, lived at home to save money, and paid for it with earnings from my full-time retail job combined with tuition vouchers from both my parents' jobs. i went to grad school abroad and paid for that with student loans.growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? did your parent/guardian(s) educate you about finances?my parents drilled into us not spending money we didn't have (i didn't get my first credit card until after grad school) and the importance of a strong work ethic.what was your first job and why did you get it?i was babysitting as soon as someone would pay me for it, around the age of 12 or 13. my first ""real"" job was at a florist at age 15. my parents insisted that if i wanted spending money, i needed to get a job as soon as i was old enough for working papers. i think the other piece of that was to teach me responsibility and the value of a dollar.did you worry about money growing up?no. while we didn't go on fancy vacations or have the newest, trendiest things, we always had everything we needed.do you worry about money now?not really. i worry that i'm going to be paying off my student loans until i die and that we may never own a home, but having a partner to share expenses with and a decent salary has allowed me to relax significantly compared to the days where i was living paycheck to paycheck with maxed out credit cards, a shitty car in constant need of repair, and nothing in savings.at what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?i guess when i started grad school at 22, although i did live with my parents rent-free for a time after i finished grad school. my partner and i have financial safety nets in the form of our wedding savings and in our parents (to an extent) if shit ever really hit the fan.do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? if yes, please explain.not yet, but when my grandparents passed away a few years ago, my mother inherited some money. apparently, about $10,000 is earmarked for me for something that is in the ""adulting"" category. i'm hoping that it will eventually go towards a down payment on a home.day one8:15 a.m. — wake up to my alarm. get up and love on my partner, l., and the more snuggly of our two cats. our other cat is somewhere sleeping off his nighttime zoomies. it's saturday but i'm supposed to drop off my weekly saliva sample at school for covid testing because we've been remote the last two days due to snow. luckily a nearby colleague is stopping to pick mine up on her way. score! once i make the hand-off, i make l. a cup of the super fancy hot chocolate i got him for valentine's day. another alarm goes off reminding me to take my antidepressant (i take it for my anxiety and panic disorder). i started medication for the first time about a month ago after feeling for months like my physiological symptoms were getting out of control and that therapy alone wasn't cutting it anymore. so far, so good. i think.10:15 a.m. — breakfast is half a gluten-free english muffin topped with cheese, bacon, a runny egg, and everything but the elote seasoning from trader joe's (everything but the bagel? i don't know her). i also treat myself to a cup of my favorite french tea that i've been rationing. then i get to work organizing and cleaning the kitchen while l. works on reorganizing his work from home set up with all these new tech toys he recently purchased.12:15 p.m. — i mask up and head over to the plant shop in town to buy a large cast iron plant that i can't stop thinking about. it's allegedly almost impossible to kill which is right up my alley. i also pick up a tiny succulent to replace one that i killed when i brought a bunch of plants home from my office at the start of distance learning last march. i also grab a small calathea with pink striped leaves. $132.7512:15 p.m. — i stop at our favorite bakery around the corner for a cinnamon roll for l. ($4.41 including $1 tip). $4.413 p.m. — make a lunch salad of romaine lettuce, rotisserie chicken, sweet potato tots, and the best lime vinaigrette from wegmans (if you don't live near a wegmans you have my deepest sympathies). l. and i watch a couple of episodes of new girl and i work on my puzzle. yes, i've become one of those pandemic puzzle people. snuggly cat comes trotting up to me with a small piece of plastic that he found who knows where and wants me to throw for him. i redirect him to playing fetch with a giant rubber band instead. zoomie cat joins in and runs up and down the hallway chasing the rubber band.8 p.m. — skip a real dinner because i've been snacking on tortilla chips and dove peanut butter eggs (the only easter candy, don't @ me). give snuggly cat his prozac (anxiety buds!) and hop in the shower. i'm an evening showerer always and forever. i take two cbd/melatonin gummies and treat my dry winter skin to glossier super bounce serum and sunday riley tidal cream. after a little more chill time with l. on the couch, i finish my nighttime routine with some r+co high dive cream in my damp hair, a klonopin to prevent nocturnal panic attacks, lush dream cream, laneige lip sleeping mask, and saje peaceful slumber oil. i get under my weighted blanket and start a new library book. lights out by 9:45.daily total: $137.16day two9 a.m. — after scrolling through news and social media for a bit, i get out of bed and start getting the laundry together. our household division of labor includes me on laundry and l. on litter box duty and somehow, we both feel like we've won. i wash my face with drunk elephant juju bar soap and put on some sunday riley good genes lactic acid treatment. it's so creamy and makes my skin super soft and smooth; perfect for no-makeup days. i pour a small glass of rook cold brew (a recommendation from a south jersey diarist — lifechanging) and make a facebook post on our town curb alert page for a box of stuff we purged during the kitchen organization yesterday.11:30 a.m. — make a brunch of shakshuka with two eggs and crumble some feta on top. continue with the laundry; it ends up being five loads. in between trips to the laundry room, i do some class prep and catch up on work email. we've been lucky enough to be safely in person most of the school year, but when we've had to pivot to remote it comes with no warning. it's exhausting and i have all the feels about all of the things, but i'm making it work and concentrating on building community above all else. teaching isn't technically part of my job description, but i do have one part-time course right now. i'm in awe of how my full-time faculty friends are making this work. $12.752:20 p.m. — head to cvs to pick up a prescription ($10 on my pre-paid flex-spending debit card). i am the ninth car in line for the drive-thru. it takes 45 minutes and i listen to an episode of black fraiser while i wait because phoebe robinson is an absolute queen. i get an email that our covid testing results are such that we'll be back in the building tomorrow. i always have mixed feelings about this but try to focus on the positive to keep the anxiety at bay.5:30 p.m. — leftover gluten-free pizza and more new girl with l. starting to feel the sunday night blues settling in. i pop a cbd gummy with a side of theanine (a new supplement i'm trying) and sit outside on the balcony playing word games on my phone until i'm so cold i can't feel my fingers.9 p.m. — same bedtime routine as last night except i use sunday riley retinoid serum and drunk elephant lala retro cream on my face. there is usually no rhyme or reason to what i put on my face when and i switch it up a lot. is this expensive-ass retinoid serum worth it? who knows. i kiss l. and the cats, set my alarm extra early, and read until around 10.daily total: $12.75day three6:15 a.m. — my alarm goes off and i'm immediately cranky about how dark it is. my workday makeup routine includes nyx concealer and bronzer, bare minerals mineral veil powder, glossier boy brow, and beauty counter volumizing mascara. get dressed in faded black everlane jeans, an oversized black aerie sweater, and black chelsea boots from target. kiss l. about a hundred times and head out the door with a small cold brew in hand by 7. get a notification that we're going to have a half-day because of snow! on the drive, i listen to our ever-evolving wedding playlist (corona bride here) and get a huge nostalgia-induced smile on my face when ""let's get married"" by jagged edge comes on. that is until they get to the line about having some babies and i fake gag. i adore babies and children and even teenagers, but l. and i are in full and enthusiastic agreement that parenthood is not for us.10 a.m. — finally come up for air and find that i'm starving. while on a zoom meeting with the other instructors for the course i'm teaching, i eat a couple of spoonfuls of the best nut butter in the world (big spoon roasters chai spice), a very mediocre granola bar, some pineapple from last week that i found in the fridge, and a chomps beef stick from the snack stash in my work bag. a totally acceptable breakfast.1 p.m. — make it home after a snowy drive including a stop at the container store for curbside pickup of some bins and baskets that i ordered and paid for last week. have just enough time to heat up a lunch of rice, chicken, baby spinach, feta, and some lemon dressing (another wegmans star) before i hop on another zoom meeting. i also have meetings at 4 and 6. sadly, early dismissal does not mean an early end to my workday. i cram three dove peanut butter eggs into my face after my meeting and complete the application for my medical marijuana card.5:30 p.m. — in between meetings, i manage to set up the bins and baskets on our baker's rack in the kitchen and am so proud of what a difference it's made to such a problem area that i send a pic to my mom and sister. my mom's response is that my compost bucket ruins the look (lol mom), but thankfully that reminds me that tomorrow morning is a compost pick up day, so i set out our bucket. i make turkey taco salad for dinner and prepare to eat in yet another zoom meeting. camera off this time since this is a professional affinity group and i'd like these people to think i'm a professional lady that doesn't constantly spill food down the front of my shirt.8:30 p.m. — done with my final meeting and dinner clean-up. i take a shower and mentally high-five myself for remembering to bring my rattlesnake plant into the bathroom so it can soak in that sweet, sweet humidity. my face is feeling super dry so i use trader joe's watermelon overnight face mask tonight. i sit on the bathroom floor and give zoomie cat all the pets. the bathroom is his favorite and one of the only places in the apartment that he will let us really love on him. he is particular af about everything. i'm beat and call it a night at 9.daily total: $0day four6:30 a.m. — alarm goes off and i'm feeling so groggy that i hit snooze three times, falling back to sleep each time. i woke up at 3:30 to the sensation of my bed shaking like there was an earthquake and then laid awake for a while, freaked out. check the news and find that there was no earthquake, so i guess it was a dream. or i'm hallucinating? get dressed in black pants/glorified leggings from loft, a black tank, a grey and black boyfriend-style blazer from banana republic, and the same boots as yesterday. pour myself a larger cold brew than normal and look for something for breakfast. my fruit and vegetable supply is disappointingly low due to an almost month-long flare-up of an undiagnosed stomach condition and i'm just starting to feel okay adding back in fiber. make a mental note to start an instacart order. head out and listen to a new-to-me podcast, my momma told me, on the drive. i pick the episode featuring jay ellis from insecure because i'm a huge lawrence stan.9:30 a.m. — i have a zoom meeting at 9:50 and am determined to eat breakfast before it starts. with this team, you have to be quick to jump in to get heard and i don't want a mouthful of food to stop me. today's random assortment is lentil hummus, brazil nuts (daily dose of selenium), baby carrots, gluten-free pita crackers, and cheese.12:30 p.m. — heat up the lunch i brought from home yesterday (chicken and rice with ghee) and supplement with romaine lettuce and buffalo cauliflower from the dining hall. manage to get a few bites in then i remember i have a student coming by in 10 minutes, so i put my food away and my mask back on.1 p.m. — actually eating lunch now while texting with my brother-in-law about birthday gifts for my sister. i give up on finishing lunch after about an hour of constant interruptions. sigh. i get a thank you card with a target gift card this morning from a sweet group of students that i helped with something and that reminds me that i need to replace a fitted sheet someone with claws ruined. cats can be such dicks. the second i open the target app, i get a text from my boss asking for some information she can't access. sigh again.4 p.m. — head out and talk to my mom on the way home. i feed the cats and relax a little bit then continue working on the couch while giving the snuggly cat all the belly rubs his sweet baby angel heart desires. l. is at his computer working overtime but it's nice to be in the same room at least.6:50 p.m. — l. and i finish work and make dinner. frozen pizza for him and half a gluten-free english muffin topped with a runny egg, cheese, and loads of everything but the elote seasoning for me. i'm really craving protein so i also reheat a scoop of the turkey taco meat from last night. i feel like i should cook a vegetable but that buffalo cauliflower at lunch did me dirty and i decide to pass. we watch bob's burgers and the great north while we eat.8:30 p.m. — same nighttime routine as usual except with beauty counter overnight resurfacing peel (look, i know that beauty counter is an mlm but i truly love some of their products and no one has ever harassed me about joining their cult) and then i play my ukulele for a while. l. listens for a bit and compliments my improving skills, then heads to bed before me for once. i manage to make it to 9:30, feed the cats second dinner, and follow behind him.daily total: $0day five6:45 a.m. — so. very. tired. out of bed by 7 for the typical morning routine. throw on a pair of american eagle jeans and a bright yellow sweater from target with my favorite tan dolce vita booties. pour a cold brew (they're getting progressively larger as the week goes on) and search for something for breakfast. i end up with a chomps beef stick, a jar of maple cinnamon pecan and peanut butter (again, big spoon — the best!), and one of l.'s rice cakes (gross). no time to make lunch so i'm at the mercy of the dining hall today. l. reminds me he has another interview for a job he's in the running for within his company. i stop in my tracks and do my best to psych him up— he works so hard and would be perfect in this new position! listen to more of my mama told me on the drive and now that i've heard a full episode i can confirm it's legit hilarious.12:25 p.m. — i cobble together a lunch of sweet chili tofu, rice, and the insides of two pork bao with really tasty pickles. on the way back to my office, i see one of our security guards that i haven't seen since before the holidays so i stop to catch up with him. these are the moments that make me appreciate being back to work in person despite all the fear and stress and anxiety. back in my office, every time i take my mask off to take a bite someone knocks on my door. i'm so hungry and haven't had a moment to myself all day. i give in to the madness until my next zoom meeting, then close my door, pull the blinds, and happily stuff my face. i treat myself to a limoncello la croix and a couple of hershey's kisses with lunch.4:04 p.m. — time to go home! i never stopped moving today. i taught my class this morning which was truly enjoyable and always a favorite part of my week. we also had a fun event which added to the madness but seeing so many happy kids is always worth the extra work.5 p.m. — i snack on some chocolate-covered hazelnuts while i catch up on slack messages in the local mutual aid group i've recently joined. i spend some time messaging with one of the sub-groups about an upcoming event and reach out to a few of my students who are passionate about this issue to see if they want to get involved. i make an easy dinner of baked sweet potato fries and another salad of romaine, chicken, feta, and lemon dressing.7:20 p.m. — my mask stash is getting low, so i buy a 20-pack of kf94 masks to wear at work on amazon and spend some time looking at sheets but i'm being picky and the evil empire isn't cutting it. $34.897:20 p.m. — remember that aerie is having a sale so i pick up this kimono-style sweater i've had my eye on. last year, i worked remotely and wore exclusively activewear (lol at the use of the word active here) all spring so this will be the first piece of spring work clothing i've bought in two years — purchase justified! $34.969 p.m. — i'm showered, moisturized, and both snuggly cat and i are medicated. i strum my ukulele for a bit, making up songs about the cats that i perform for them, and while they don't seem impressed, they are a surprisingly good audience. l. is definitely entertained so my job here is done. work on my instacart list in bed and once i'm horizontal, i'm ready to pass out.daily total: $69.85day six6:30 a.m. — get up and have to spend some time filling a vial with saliva since it's a covid testing day. the cats hang out with me in the bathroom (one wants food, one wants pets) until l. gets up to feed them. i also have to spend some time on my hair this morning. i have what i like to call a ""texture mullet,"" slightly wavy in the front and very wavy — but not in a good way — in the back. i do what i can with a comb, a quick pass with the straightening iron, and some trader joe's shea butter and coconut oil hair serum on my ends. get dressed in the same black loft pants from two days ago (it's a pandemic, don't judge), a black tank, an oversized buffalo plaid cardigan with pockets, and my beloved black boots. pour a small cold brew that i drink in the car while listening to sinisterhood.8:50 a.m. — after spending the first part of the morning outdoors for a fun little event, breakfast is egg salad and grapes that i got from the dining hall yesterday. i'm now wishing i had more caffeine. i settle for a heavy spread of chai spice nut butter on another rice cake.1 p.m. — finally time for lunch: turkey taco meat from home supplemented with cilantro lime rice from the dining hall. i grabbed a salad too, but i fill up on taco meat (spoiler alert: i will come to regret this). i also have a polar black cherry seltzer. i finish my instacart order in between meetings with students and get a pickup slot for right after work today. forgot i had a 4:30 meeting (on top of a webinar and a virtual event this evening) so i'm going to have to hustle. i ordered a gluten-free pizza, a regular pizza, milk, cheese, shallots, thyme, mushrooms, cucumbers, pineapple, apples, hummus, dolmas, eggs, a rotisserie chicken, and frozen gluten-free smoked gouda mac and cheese. $66.013:10 p.m. — leave work on the earlier side to drive to wegmans for my instacart pick up and then head right home. i have just enough time to unload groceries and lay on the couch for 10 minutes before my meeting. i have horrible agida (acid reflux/heartburn/stomach upset if you're not from an italian-american family) from that taco meat.6:52 p.m. — in between work and more work, i check my email and see that my medical marijuana card application was approved so i pay the fee. $1006:52 p.m. — i also realize that my tax return hit my account a few days ago— time to spend some money! first, i use a 20% off code and purchase a new bottle of sunday riley good genes, r+co dry shampoo, and grown alchemist hand cream from dermstore ($134.13). this is the one frivolous treat i planned for this money. $134.136:52 p.m. — next, i (drumroll, please) pay off one of my student loans!!! it's the smaller of my two loans, but it still feels so good. l. remembers to bring the plant into the bathroom while he showers, empties the dishwasher, does the dishes that have piled up in the sink, and makes me a gluten-free pizza for dinner while i get back to work. he's a friggin' gem. $603.749 p.m. — it's been a long day/night. usual nighttime routine except with half a klonopin pill tonight. i've been on a new dose of my anxiety meds for almost a week now and have been feeling really good so i really think i can get rid of the nightly klonopin altogether, but i don't want to test that theory on a school night. lights out by 10.daily total: $903.88day seven6:38 a.m. — wake up before my alarm with a migraine. i pop a prescription migraine pill and lay really still for the next 25 minutes or so and feel okay when i get up. i put on my black lives matter t-shirt with a different pair of black loft legging-type pants, a black and white patterned cardigan from target, and black suede and leather high tops. take some time to talk with l. and we end up laughing hysterically at a joke i make and he keeps riffing on. one of my favorite parts of our relationship is that we're really in sync humor-wise. in the car by 7:50 and put on a random older playlist. a song that reminds me of my sister comes on and i smile hugely, then want to cry because i miss her so much. she's my best friend and we talk, facetime, or text every single day but i haven't seen her in over a year. stupid pandemic.9:26 a.m. — breakfast today is cucumbers, hummus, pineapple, and a chomps beef stick. and another cold brew.1:22 p.m. — didn't really make a lunch plan so i end up with tofu and veggies in a sweet and spicy sauce. i work on a boring spreadsheet while i eat. i'm craving something sweet and there is no candy to be found so i settle for scraping a dollop of chocolate frosting off of a little piece of cake from the dining hall (i am a garbage person).5 p.m. — i get home on the late side today because i had a small group meeting for the mutual aid organization and it made more sense to log on from work than rush to get home. i've been wanting to get more involved in my local community and this really feels like the right place for me. as soon as i walk in the door, i hit up my stash of dove eggs and wolf down two.6:21 p.m. — for dinner, i finish the pizza from last night and pineapple from breakfast while placing a costco delivery order for tomorrow. we get chicken breasts, doritos, granola bars, chocolate chip cookies, cereal, and i add tampons, pads, canned chicken, applesauce pouches, and more granola bars for the food pantry ($134.86 including a 20% tip). l. pays for this one. typically i pay for the weekly grocery shopping while l. takes care of the monthly cat food/medicine/treat shopping and the occasional costco shop.10:40 p.m. — bedtime after a fun zoom gathering with my work pals. we haven't gotten together outside of work since pre-pandemic times and many of us rarely see each other in the building these days so it felt like a real celebration to all be ""together."" this group of people has helped me keep my sanity in so many ways not just during the pandemic and i truly appreciate them. l. is playing some online video game with friends he also hasn't seen in a long time, but he pops over to say hi to everyone. such a nice end to what felt like the longest week in history.daily total: $0"

daycare: $200 (m. pays the remaining $450.)was there an expectation for you to attend higher education? did you participate in any form of higher education? if yes, how did you pay for it?it wasn't expected of me but i knew my parents would prefer it. they also would've supported me if i chose not to, as long as i could financially support myself. i went to an in-state school and got my bachelor's. i was very lucky i did not have to take out student loans. my tuition was mostly covered by fafsa and grants for low-income people, and i did work-study for the remainder. my partner, m., had to take out student loans. we were able to pay these off with the profit from the sale of our previous house, which was owned by me. he now pays extra in mortgage to offset this.growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? did your parent/guardian(s) educate you about finances?i was raised by my mom and we never had any conversations about money. we were very low-income and i think she didn't want to stress me out with money problems.what was your first job and why did you get it?i was 12 or 13. i got a job filling paper bags with peanuts for tourists to buy and feed to the chipmunks. i was paid cash under the table.did you worry about money growing up?i don't specifically remember worrying about it, but i know my mom struggled a lot. i always knew not to ask for anything i absolutely didn't need. i really appreciate my mom for working hard to give me what she could, and i believe i valued that used gameboy or ice cream cone or new barbie so much more.do you worry about money now?i don't worry about money in the present but i worry about my retirement. i know social security isn't fully solvent so i almost feel like i shouldn't count on it at all (despite a lifetime spent contributing to it). i worry that m. isn't thinking about retirement living as seriously as i am.at what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?i was mostly responsible for myself at 15, paying for my own car insurance, school activity fees, clothes, etc. i became fully responsible (i.e. rent, bills, groceries) when i started college. i do have a safety net and i just got my emergency fund up to three months salary.do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? if yes, please explain.not really. my maternal grandmother gave me $5,000 to help with the down payment of my first home. my dad gives me $1,000 twice a year at christmas and my birthday but that only started in my mid-20s.day one5:15 a.m. — my partner's (m.) alarm goes off. he got an apple watch about six months ago and uses the vibrate alarm option so he doesn't wake me up. thanks, sweetie!7:30 a.m. — the boundless ball of energy in the form of a dog has decided it's time to get up. our older dog sighs heavily. i no longer set an alarm because i know the dogs will wake me up by 8 for their breakfast. i let them out back to do their business and make a half pot of coffee for myself.8 a.m. — i get ready for work while my elderly cat sits next to the heating vent and yells at me to turn the heat on. i check the thermostat and realize it's 63° in the house. okay, kitty, i get it. the heat clicks on shortly after. i throw chicken, broth, and herbs in the crockpot for dinner. i eat breakfast (evol breakfast bowl) and pour the rest of the coffee into a travel mug to drink during my commute.8:50 a.m. — i leave the house for work. the younger dog usually goes to doggy daycare on days m. and i both go into work but he's currently being treated for giardia. we've crate trained him but don't like leaving him in there for more than a couple of hours. m. thinks he'll be home by 11, but if things go sideways, he's close enough that he can come home on his lunch break. i listen to the three-body problem by cixin liu from the library through an app on my phone on my way to work.9:20 a.m. — i arrive at work. parking is free right now (normally $135/month). pre-pandemic i commuted by bus ($15/month for unlimited rides through work) and i would spend three hours a day commuting (traffic was so bad that i would've spent close to the same amount of time in a single-occupancy vehicle). now i can get to work in 30 minutes with everyone being wfh.10:15 a.m. — i've got my experiments running and have a couple of hours to kill. normally i'd start in on administrative work for the lab as i'm also the lab manager but i forgot to pick up my prescription yesterday. i was diagnosed with breast cancer at 36 (check your boobies!!) and now that i've completed treatment, i need to take hormone therapy for five years to decrease the chance of it coming back. i walk to pick up my prescription. it's $114 for a 30-day supply but my insurance covers the entire cost.11:35 a.m. — my boss calls me into his office and tells me i will be getting a raise in april. i'm currently underpaid and academia tends to pay less than industry. a raise will bring me up to the (academic) mid-range of what i should be making.1:30 p.m. — lunchtime. our campus has scaled food service way back since during the pandemic. i go with a pre-made blt, chips, and coke. it's disappointing. $13.874:30 p.m. — done with work. my boss only expects us to stay as long as we need to to get our work done. some days that's six hours, some days it's 10 hours, and sometimes i'm staying up until 5 a.m. to collect data.5:20 p.m. — arrive home. traffic was bad. m. needs help unloading wood from the truck. he started a new hobby during the pandemic: wood turning. he joined the local guild two weeks ago and has already made the membership fee back with free wood. i text my best friend, l. about doing a zoom workout. we both struggle with motivation and agreed to meet three times a week for a 30- to 60-minute workout following youtube videos. i'm sweaty by the end and the shower feels extra nice.7 p.m. — m. and i were supposed to use the crockpot chicken in a chicken and wild rice soup but he has last-minute work training and i'm too hungry to wait for soup to simmer. tj's gorgonzola gnocchi it is. we'll use the chicken another day. i eyeball the bottle of red i opened last night. the rest of the evening is spent watching tv and finishing off the wine.10:30 p.m. — bedtime for me.daily total: $13.87day two3 a.m. — i wake up and i'm pretty sure i need to vomit or shit or both. yup, it's both. stupid wine. sometimes i can drink an entire bottle myself and be completely fine, other times (like now) 1.5 glasses will do me in. i can't fall back asleep.7:45 a.m. — the puppers get us up. i'm dragging ass and i still feel off. i should've washed my hair last night. dry shampoo to the rescue. i manage to eat an english muffin with butter and drink some coffee.8:45 a.m. — leave for work. m. is wfh today but we decide the older dog could do with some playtime so i drop her off at daycare on the way to work. young dog still can't go so he'll stay home and torment m. with his excessive energy.9:30 a.m. — arrive at work. i'm definitely feeling better but still riding the struggle bus. there's a present on my desk! i had forgotten my peer mentoring group is doing a galentine's secret cupid this afternoon. i sent my present out earlier this week.10:30 a.m. — i'm hungry. coffee and donut time! this is probably a mistake. $5.241:15 p.m. — lunchtime. i didn't even think about grabbing leftovers so i'm buying lunch again. i opt for a mediterranean salad. $9.081:15 p.m. — i see the science fiction and fantasy short film festival has been scheduled for next month, virtually, of course. i used to go every year but have missed some in recent years. i pay extra for the sustainer level because i like the work that siff does. $304 p.m. — time to meet (over zoom) with my peer group and open gifts! this is a really excellent group of women in science who are on a similar career path as i am. i get some excellent tea, an octopus towel, and a lovely poem by julia bird.6:10 p.m. — arrive home. i picked up the dog from daycare on the way home. we still have days left on our package so i don't owe anything.7 p.m. — m. isn't hungry for dinner and has a big boss fight scheduled with his video game posse. i'm on my own for dinner so i grab a tj's mac & cheese from the freezer. i'm not really in the mood for it but i'm starting to get hangry.10 p.m. — m. has to be up early for work tomorrow so we head to bed.daily total: $44.32day three5:15 a.m. — m.'s alarm goes off. it's his birthday today but he has to go into work.7:45 a.m. — i have a busy day ahead. i stop for an almond milk hazelnut latte and scone ($9.24+tip) at a local coffee drive-thru. i run to the grocery store for dinner ingredients including beef tenderloin, potatoes, green beans, shallots, horseradish, crème fraîche, sausage, and vanilla ice cream. i have to go to two different stores to get everything i need ($80.84 and $7.88). i knew i should've made crème fraîche myself because a little tub costs $5.99. i just didn't plan ahead. i have been saving a nice bottle of wine for the occasion and i have all the ingredients for cherry pie so i can skip buying those. $98.969:30 a.m. — i signed up for a seminar through the local gardening association a couple of weeks ago and it's today. there was a suggested donation of $5 when signing up.10:45 a.m. — time to workout with l. we find that our favorite youtube mixxedfit instructor is offering classes online and makes plans to attend one next saturday. it's hard to find an instructor who is good at giving cues to what comes next and we really enjoy her energy.12:30 p.m. — m. just got home and he wants wendy's for lunch. he gave up fast food back in december so this is a birthday treat for him. i run out to get a 4 for $4 meal and a combo. i check the mail on the way back and i'm relieved that the last of m.'s presents have finally arrived. the rest of the afternoon will be spent making his birthday dinner and dessert. $18.827 p.m. — dinner time. i follow several recipes on the nyt cooking app. the beef tenderloin turns out really nice. i was worried because it's an expensive cut of meat. we have candlesticks but no holders. i raid m.'s scrap wood for some small blocks and have him drill holes most of the way through. boom! now we're fancy bitches.8:45 p.m. — m. opens his presents (woodturning blades and unisex bath bombs). we slice up the cherry pie and watch the newest episode of wandavision on disney+.10:30 p.m. — m. is sleepy from having to get up early (and also the booze, i suspect) so we head to bed.daily total: $117.78day four7:45 a.m. — up early to start on m.'s birthday breakfast: biscuits and gravy with mimosas.10:10 a.m. — m. got another free wood alert and i'm going with him to help load. he's gotten three truckloads in less than two weeks! he has three days off work and plenty of wood to practice on. everyone is getting bowls for christmas this year.12:15 p.m. — home and m. makes a second pot of coffee because he's still a bit hungover from last night. i don't really know what to do with myself. i have several projects in the works but don't feel like doing them. this is probably why they're still works-in-progress… i opt instead for the nyt sunday crossword. i'm struggling with it this week and can only get about a third done without help. i switch over to my cross stitch project that m. gave me for christmas: rosalind franklin's photo 51. i put on studio ghibli's nausicaa of the valley of the winds (hbo max) followed by blade runner 2049 (owned). my elderly cat wants some lap time so i have to juggle the embroidery hoop, cross stitch pattern, and a cat who wants to play with the string.5:03 p.m. — it's after 5 so i can have a glass of wine. i pair it with some manchego cheese. perfect pre-dinner snack except the dogs keep trying to eat my cheese and the cat has stuck her entire head in my wine glass twice.6:30 p.m. — m. makes burgers for dinner. they are so good and good food is my joy so i'm pretty happy right now. although it doesn't seem like it based on the last few days, m. does most of the cooking.8 p.m. — i got my stitchfix box yesterday and need to make a decision about the clothes. i absolutely hate clothes shopping, especially if i have to do it online. i get easily overwhelmed by it. i signed up for stitchfix and it works for me. i scored a style pass so i don't pay a styling fee, even if i send everything back. i need some more jeans but don't like either of the pairs they sent to me. i keep the shirts though ($141.32). m. and i grab a shower, then some pie and settle in to watch tenet (which we got the other week on sale). $141.3211 p.m. — bedtime but my brain is still trying to work through tenet so it's a while before i fall asleep.daily total: $141.32day five7:30 a.m. — good morning mr. puppy. yes, i hear you. good morning elderly kitty. yes, i hear you as well. anyone else want to chime in?8:40 a.m. — headed off to work. i finished the three-body problem (would recommend!), so it's time to pick a new book. i see heartberries by terese marie mailhot is available to borrow. my book club is discussing it at the end of the month. it's a quick read so i decide to wait until the meeting is closer. i opt instead for the starless sea by erin morgenstern which just became available. i stop for a 16-oz mocha and a cheese danish. $9.089:15 a.m. — i arrive at work and realize i forgot to take the covid-19 screening survey. i have to pull over and take it before scanning my key card or else my boss and i get a very sternly worded email from the administration (followed by disciplinary action if it happens repeatedly). i was in the middle of chemotherapy when the pandemic hit so i very much appreciate all the precautions that were taken. happy to report we've had zero on-campus transmission.12:50 p.m. — lunchtime. i get the mediterranean salad ($9.36) again. the cost has gone up $0.28? no, the base price is still the same so sales tax must have changed. sales tax is ridiculously high at 10.1% but there's no state income tax so it balances out (haha, just kidding, we have one of the most regressive tax structures in the country with a higher share of the tax burden placed on low-income workers). $9.365 p.m. — i'm home from work. my afternoon did not go well and i'm a little grumpy. i pour myself half glass of wine and finish off the manchego. i remind m. we should use the crockpot chicken from last week for soup. he says he doesn't feel like soup and wants frozen pizza (which i hate) and we get into a little tiff. it ends with us both apologizing. m. promises to make the soup tomorrow. i watch pitch perfect (hbo max) while eating tj's vegetable fried rice with two eggs scrambled into it. i've never seen the movie and i enjoy it more than i thought i would (and it puts me in a better mood).7:30 p.m. — i amuse myself by taking slow-mo videos of the dogs catching treats and working on the monday nyt crossword. we watch the newest episodes of last week tonight, family guy, and the simpsons and do laundry. i'm completely out of clean pants and i probably wore the dirty ones for longer than i should have.11 p.m. — bedtime.daily total: $18.44day six7:30 a.m. — my boob wakes me up. it's been more than a year since surgery but i still get occasional nerve pain. i'm lucky i didn't lose my entire breast, just a chunk, and it's not particularly noticeable unless you look hard.8 a.m. — our last load of laundry last night was pants and they're still slightly damp. i put them on speed dry. once they're done, i get to put on fresh-from-the-dryer jeans. it's like heaven. there's no way today is going to be a bad day. breakfast of english muffin with butter, an orange, and coffee. i pour some more coffee into a travel mug for the commute.11:55 a.m. — lunchtime and i'm craving tacos. i order from a new place and get three different types plus a mexican coke ($11.23). it's a 10-minute walk and i regret not grabbing my hand sanitizer so i can dig in asap. i arrive back at campus, wash my hands, and dive in. they are so good. $11.233 p.m. — my co-worker brought in chocolate chip sea salt cookies to celebrate my boss's birthday. it's exactly what i need for the 3 p.m. slump.5:45 p.m. — arrive home and jump right into a workout with l. she says in california she's now eligible, as a university employee, for the covid-19 vaccine. i'm jealous! i take a shower.7:30 p.m. — i know you all have been on the edge of your seat wondering if m. used the crockpot chicken today. happy to report we are having chicken soup for dinner. we also heat up some tj's naan. m. makes us french 75's with the leftover bubbly from his birthday brunch. we finish off the last of the pie. i spend the rest of the evening working on the tuesday crossword and looking at magazines i checked out from the library (on my ipad).10 p.m. — m. has to be at work at 6 tomorrow so it's bedtime. i'm not super tired so i stay up and watch an episode of bones (amazon prime).daily total: $11.23day seven5:15 a.m. — m. must've slept through his vibrate alarm because his phone alarm wakes me up.7:30 a.m. — my alarm goes off. i'm attending a virtual workshop on cryo-electron microscopy today and tomorrow, and it starts at 8 a.m. i take care of the dogs and cat, make half a pot of coffee, and sit down in front of my computer while still in my pj's. i'm not going to be on camera so i'm going to be uber comfortable.9:30 a.m. — we have a brief break so i eat some breakfast. it's an english muffin with butter, an orange, and another cup of coffee.12:30 p.m. — we end 90 minutes earlier than i expected. i can't say i'm disappointed because, while there's useful information, a lot of it feels like a very long sales pitch. i'm hoping tomorrow is more informative. my lunch is leftover soup. my mom texts me that my aunt broke her leg and asks if i can drive out to the peninsula next weekend to help her out.1:15 p.m. — m. arrives home for lunch (leftover soup). he was only supposed to work a half-day today but one of his co-workers called in sick so he'll work a full twelve hours. the weather is sunny so he takes the dogs out back for a quick game of fetch.3:15 p.m. — the older dog's nails are entering jersey shore territory so it's time for a trim. we've tried doing this ourselves, with a variety of tools, but it ends up being traumatic for all involved. no amount of treats, peanut butter, or cheese will convince the dog she's not about to be murdered. i take her to our favorite local grooming place and they're done in about five minutes ($15 + $3 tip). i stop by starbucks on the way home, mostly to get a puppachino as an apology, but i also get a chocolate almond milk shaken espresso and a slice of lemon loaf ($9.36). $27.366:30 p.m. — dinner is leftover hamburger patties, except we don't have any buns or ketchup. m. chops up the patties, adds some spices, and puts them in hard taco shells with melted cheese, lettuce, onion, and salsa. we have some spiced tater tots on the side and vanilla coke zero. i give my aunt a call to check in on her.8 p.m. — i watch the lost boys and drive m. crazy by serenading him (poorly) until bedtime. playing video games with a live mic? surprise serenade! peeing? serenade through the door! putting on pj's? serenade with dance moves!10:30 p.m. — bedtime. thanks for hanging out with me, folks!daily

did you participate in any form of higher education? if yes, how did you pay for it?in the suburb i grew up in, everyone went to college after high school so i always knew i would follow that path and never considered doing otherwise. i had really good grades and test scores in high school so the majority of my education was paid for by a large merit scholarship. i paid the remaining tuition for my first semester with my savings from high school because i wanted to contribute to my own education. my parents paid for the subsequent semesters. i'm very thankful to have graduated with no student loans and i recognize my privilege.related storiesa week in brooklyn, ny, on a $116,000 salarya week in philadelphia, pa, on a $54,000 salarya week in st. paul, mn, on a $58,000 salarygrowing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? did your parent/guardian(s) educate you about finances?my parents never really educated me about personal finance. it probably didn't help that my mom was not involved in my family's finances and she is the parent i spent the majority of my time with. the one thing i remember is my mom often telling me that it is better to spend more on a quality item than to get the cheapest option and have it be poor quality.what was your first job and why did you get it?i started babysitting and dog sitting when i was 13 so i could start saving for my future. this is how i was able to pay for my first semester of college out of pocket. i never spent the money i made. when i was 16, i got a job working in the cafeteria of a retirement home but had to quit after a few months because of a medical emergency. when i was 18, i started working at an escape room and continued working there for over three years.did you worry about money growing up?all the time. my family was not ""struggling,"" we were solidly upper-middle-class, but i was hyper-aware of how much my existence cost my parents. my extracurricular activities and medical bills were expensive and i was constantly reminded of this and experienced a great deal of guilt surrounding these costs.do you worry about money now?until very recently, yes. when i met my partner, she had been working full-time at her career-job for two years and i was working part-time in retail. it was really hard for me to keep up with our shared lifestyle on my income and i would occasionally borrow money from my parents to pay for our dates. after i got my first full-time job three months ago, i immediately paid my parents back everything i had borrowed and started saving aggressively while also being able to afford myself a much better lifestyle. i still worry about money but not as much.at what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?i am still not financially responsible for myself. not even close. all of my basic needs are met by my parents. i'm very comfortable with this for the present moment because it gives me the ability to save large chunks of my income. i know that even once i move out, i could always rely on my parents if i needed something.do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? if yes, please explain.my grandfather created a mutual fund for me, as previously stated.day one7 a.m. — my alarm goes off and i scroll on tiktok for about half an hour before finally getting out of bed. breakfast is a plain bagel with globs of butter. we got heaps of snow so i spend a solid 10 minutes scraping my car before i'm finally on the road by 8:50. i listen to my favorite personal finance podcast, she's on the money as i drive to work.11 a.m. — i eat some cauliflower and a larabar before my noon staff meeting because i know i will get way too hungry if i wait until it's over. the staff meeting runs smoothly but i get caught up with work after so i don't get around to lunch until 1:30. lunch consists of a frozen chicken and broccoli alfredo bowl, a green juice, and animal crackers.3 p.m. — i fill my 24oz tumbler with water and add two packets of crystal light with caffeine. i don't like coffee and these packets have really helped me curb my starbucks spending.4:30 p.m. — i leave work a bit early because i'm ahead on hours for the week. i decided to give up weekday shopping for lent so i've been eagerly anticipating friday so i can get some errands done. i'm not super religious, but i do like the idea of setting a 40-day goal. plus the catholic guilt certainly helps me stick to it. as i park to go to the thrift store, i realize i have to pee but the goodwill doesn't have a bathroom. i go into a coffee shop in the same plaza and ask to use the bathroom. i'm proud of myself for resisting the urge to be polite and buy something. i'm sure this barista doesn't really care anyway. i'm here on a mission to get my brother's birthday gifts. i pick out three sweaters and a shirt for him and can't resist picking up an early 2000s mini bag for myself. $26.615:45 p.m. — the next stop is a resale clothing store. i'm selling six things, half of which are my girlfriends. i try on a matching sweatsuit i saw posted on the store's instagram and it's divine. the original price is $20 but i have a $10 off rewards coupon plus i get $21.72 for the items i sold, so i apply my coupon and do an exchange which gets me the sweatsuit for free plus $11 in cash. i venmo my girlfriend, m., $7.62 for the items that were hers.6:30 p.m. — my mom orders pizza and breadsticks for dinner. it's delicious and i certainly enjoy all the free meals i get living with my parents. we watch an episode of selling sunset while we eat and then she heads to bed. i call m. and we talk for about an hour. after we hang up i watch mindless youtube.1 a.m. — i haven't stayed up this late in months. i end up on the thredup app looking for a pair of jeans. i recently ripped the seat out of one of my two pairs of work jeans and i've been looking for a replacement. i'm not the hugest fan of thredup, but since i stopped buying new clothing altogether about two years ago, i will check thredup when i can't find something in a brick-and-mortar thrift store. their return policy is kind of shady, there is a $1.99 restocking fee and if you want a refund instead of store credit there are more fees. i decide on a pair of land's end denim. my total with shipping and tax is $40.90 but i have a credit for $13.05 from a previous return so i only end up spending $28.85. i need sleep. i put on some asmr to help me get there. $28.85daily total: $55.46day two10 a.m. — late start because i was up so late. i put on the astrology crewneck m. got me for valentine's day. my dad brings home donuts from a local pastry shop for breakfast. i pack an overnight bag to go visit m. for the weekend. she lives about an hour away so we only really see each other on the weekends and tend to do a lot of overnights to make the trip worth it. never have i ever met a lesbian couple that isn't at least a little bit long distance. on the road by noon. i pick up some yellow roses for m. at kroger. $9.621 p.m. — as i'm getting off the interstate, i see a homeless man and give him a dollar ($1). i meet m. at her apartment and we head out to start our day together. we go to cane's for lunch and she buys. we stop at target and i get tech wipes, a pair of blue light glasses, and organic menstrual pads and liners. ($19.65). i get starbucks there for myself and m. but my app is already loaded so it doesn't cost anything. $20.654 p.m. — we stop at bath & body works and i get myself five pocket hand sanitizers and a candle for my mom because there's a good sale ($25.82). we hit up a few more stores and eventually end up at a local bookstore. m. buys me an astrology book as a gift (she's so good to me) and i get us coffee and muffins from the coffee store inside ($13.75). $39.577:30 p.m. — we decide to go to ikea to look for a new bookcase for me. i find one i like but it's out of stock. i get m. a milk frother and myself one of the rainbow shopping bags and a bucket hat made out of an ikea bag that i definitely don't need but lizard brain said ""get it"" ($10.62). m. and i drive through skyline for dinner and i pay. she's a cheap date, our total is ($10.77). $21.399 p.m. — we stop at a sex toy store to look for bed restraints and we find a set we like. this is something m. and i have been wanting to try out for a while. i also pick up a pink lace bra from their lingerie section and a novelty rainbow test tube shot glass set for m. since she is a scientist. i drop $85.19. when i get home i realize the bra is was way too small and i facetime my friend to see if she wants it and she does. m. and i turn on survivor in bed and i fall asleep by midnight. $85.19daily total: $176.42day three7 a.m. — m. and i always tend to inadvertently wake up early during our sleepover weekends. i drift in and out of sleep until about 9 then after breakfast (frozen mini breakfast sandwiches and yogurt) and a shower, we have sex for a few hours before driving down the road to get some lunch. we go to our favorite local pizza place, m. has a $5 off coupon but i pay. it's $11.16 for two slices of za and two breadsticks plus tip. we eat at m.'s apartment then head back out. $11.161:30 p.m. — m. needs a piece of plywood to replace some broken slats in her bed so we stop in lowe's. she grabs some new knobs for her dresser as well. then we drive-thru dunkin. i get a refresher and m. gets cold brew. she pays.2:30 p.m. — we stop at an abandoned mall we have been wanting to check out. it's massive and has really cool early aughts nostalgia vibes. the best part about a mall with no stores is i can't spend any money, something i seem to be doing a lot of this weekend.4 p.m. — our next stop is home goods where i get a pack of 35 hangers for my mom. she venmos me for them immediately. m. needs to make a return at target, and after making a lap around the store, i get us starbucks. i need to reload my card and i add $10. it's rare m. and i go a weekend without going to target at least twice. and we can't go to target without getting starbucks apparently. $106 p.m. — after m. and i watch another episode of survivor, it's time for me to head home. goodbyes are really hard for us, even when we know we will see each other again in a week. i make it home, heat up a can of spaghettios for dinner, watch some more youtube, and read in bed (city of girls by elizabeth gilbert) before shutting my eyes at 10.daily total: $21.16day four8:30 a.m. — i overslept this morning! ack! i have a microwavable breakfast sandwich and a slice of apple pie ala mode for breakfast because i believe every meal deserves to be punctuated with dessert. despite oversleeping, i'm the first one at the office when i arrive at 10.1 p.m. — i heat up a trader joe's baked ziti and graze on carrots, broccoli, yogurt, pretzels, cheese, a smoothie, kombucha, and a cupcake for the remainder of the day. i get very hungry at work so i pack a lot of food and eat it in small bursts throughout the day.7 p.m. — wow! i stayed at work much later than i intended. i hate ""hustle culture,"" but i definitely fall prey to attaching my value to my productivity. i'm working on a huge social media campaign that is quite time-consuming. i'm the head of social media so this workload was self-imposed, but i'm hoping the return will be worth it.7:30 p.m. — i clean the kitchen for my mom and make myself butternut squash ravioli with tomato basil sauce courtesy of trader joe's. i start season 3 of good trouble then get ready for bed. i recently decided to start doing a more elaborate skincare routine, more so for self-care rather than actually wanting to change anything about my skin. yves rocher riche creme cleanser, some sort of tarte serum (it was a gift), trader joe's eye cream, trader joe's gel moisturizer, and burt's bees night cream. read in bed until 10:30.daily total: $0day five8 a.m. — oversleep again, but not quite as drastically. same breakfast as yesterday. variation of the same skincare routine but with a different cleanser from sheamoisture, burt's bees acne spot treatment (smells like licorice), and the burt's bees day lotion. arrive to work at 10 but i am not the first one here so no brownie points for me.12 p.m. — my lunches are essentially the same every day but the frozen entrees change. today it's trader joe's mac and cheese. i know i gave up shopping for lent but i am a very bad catholic so i cave and buy a barely-used glossier milky jelly cleanser from a facebook buy-sell group for only $10. sorry, jesus, but that's a really good deal. $104:15 p.m. — it's a much calmer day today at work and since i worked late yesterday, i decide to reward myself and leave early. i stop at trader joe's (can you tell i like trader joe's?) and get bread, milk, sour cream, and apples for my family. i don't pay for any groceries while living at home so i swipe my mom's card. i head across the street to kroger to get the remainder of my groceries — kombucha, frozen burritos, pretzels, trash bags, and nicotine lozenges for my mom. she quit vaping a few months ago and i am so proud of her!5:30 p.m. — i stop at the resell store again to sell a fleece jacket that my mom got as a promotional item with her skincare order. it's cute, it just didn't fit either of us. she lets me keep the $4.88 that the store gives me for it.6:45 p.m. — my brother comes home (he moved out a few months ago) so my mom makes enchiladas for the family. she informs me they will be way too spicy for me so i make a quesadilla with cheese, corn, and black beans. it's a weird combo, but it works. i convince my brother to watch one of my favorite movies, sorry to bother you, with me because i know he will love it and he does. trader joe's dark chocolate peanut butter cups and cheap rosé accompany the film. skincare, read, and bed by 10:30.daily total: $10day six7 a.m. — i did not oversleep but somehow am still running late? breakfast is the same sandwich with a different slice of pie. make it to the office a little before 10 just in time to greet my volunteer. i get her set up with tasks for the day and head upstairs to my office.12:30 p.m. — today's entree is a trader joe's indian butter chicken and it's the best one yet! it's been a relatively slow day but i'm knocking things off my to-do list. the big social media campaign i've been working on is practically finished so that feels good.2:30 p.m. — i have a zoom call set up with a friend from college who needs to interview someone who works at a non-profit for her class. i love talking about my job plus catching up with her is so nice.4 p.m. — i have a meeting with a community partner who is hosting a drive for us to pick up collection barrels. this is the most high-profile community partnership i have worked on so far and i'm very excited.5:30 p.m. — i drive to kroger after work to get all-purpose flour, frozen breakfast sandwiches, and a few bird's eye frozen veggie pasta steamer bags. so yummy and the pasta is made entirely from veggies and it's grain-free. definitely check out if you are on a restricted diet. again, i use mom's card to pay for groceries. i call m. from the parking lot and we end up talking for several hours. i get emotional thinking about how a lot of my friends have moved or are about to move out of state, which is something i'm sure a lot of twenty-somethings can relate to. when i get home around 8, i'm too blue for a proper dinner but i manage to eat a slice of sweet potato pie and drink a smoothie.daily total: $0day seven8 a.m. — surprise surprise! i overslept! there is currently a hole in my ceiling that was cut out to inspect for mold that is finally being repaired today (it's been there for like two months) so i make sure my room is tidy enough for the worker to be able to do his job. i skip the pie and just have a breakfast sandwich. m. sent me a $5 starbucks gift card with a koala saying ""hang in there"" when i was sad last night so i use that to mobile order a pink drink from starbucks which i pick up on my way to the office. i arrive at 10:15. oof. i'm glad my workplace is flexible on arrival/departure times, i know my late mornings wouldn't fly elsewhere.12 p.m. — due to my lack of pie, i'm hungry by noon. veggie mac and cheese purchased last night is my entree today and i graze on the same snacks as always throughout the day.5:15 p.m. — i leave work and get stuck in some nasty traffic. thankfully, i have my finance podcast to keep me occupied during the extra-long commute. i quickly run inside, change out of my work clothes and into the sweatsuit i got earlier in the week, eat a cheese stick, and gulp down a glass of water. today is my first day volunteering at a non-profit supporting trans folks and i'm already running late due to traffic. i make it to the volunteer site by 6:25 and get to work. we finish sorting all the donations by 7:40.8:30 p.m. — after talking to m. for a bit in the parking lot, i head into walgreens to pick up zzzquil for my mom, i get two packs because there is a sale, plus a l'oreal toner for me and a pack of peanut m&ms for my mom. i put it all on her card. i also buy myself nuggets, fries, and a frosty from wendy's using her card (with permission, of course). i am going to take advantage of the luxuries of living at home as long as i can. i watch another episode of good trouble while i eat. before going to bed, i check my bank account and see that my direct deposit hit so i send my mom $100 on venmo to go towards the car repair mentioned previously. i skip my skincare routine and reading and am in bed by 11:15. $100daily total: $100"

expectation for you to attend higher education? did you participate in any form of higher education? if yes, how did you pay for it?yes, it was expected that i'd go to college but we never had any conversations about it. my parents immigrated to the u.s. in the mid-1970s. my parents were clueless about the u.s. education system, sats, etc, and they had little time/interest/mental space to learn about it. i did my best to figure things out on my own. my father did not complete high school. after completing his military service, he worked in various labor roles. he was smart, but not formally educated. my mother was grad educated. when they got to the u.s., she immediately had me and my sibling. she simultaneously learned english and studied for her boards in the u.s. my father died when i was a teenager. he was no longer the main breadwinner by the time i became a preteen. i've never taken any student loans. my mother planned for and paid my tuition for undergraduate, master's, and doctoral programs. she also paid my rent all of those years. i am well aware of my privilege, though it came at a price.related storiesa week in brooklyn, ny, on a $116,000 salarya week in philadelphia, pa, on a $54,000 salarya week in st. paul, mn, on a $58,000 salarygrowing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? did your parent/guardian(s) educate you about finances?we did not really have conversations about money, or anything really. my parents were always working and stressed about money and a slew of other things. the list of things to worry about when you are immigrants is endless, made much more difficult when you try to navigate it all in your second language and a culture that is so different from your native one. i think my parents tried to keep financial stress from me and my sibling, but there really was no way that they could. my mother never sat me down to teach me anything really, i just picked things up and eventually built some sort of plan for my financial future that did not involve an inheritance or help from anyone at all.what was your first job and why did you get it?my first job was working for my mother's business, which i'd do in the summers, mostly. i was about 14. i had short-term retail jobs here and there from my late teenage years through undergrad, but i wouldn't last long in any of them. so i don't even count these as jobs in my life narrative. my first long-term steady jobs were during graduate school, working in my intended field.did you worry about money growing up?yes and no. i worried more about the tension and instability in our home due to my parents' troubled relationship, though finances were not that far behind. my parents were obsessive about saving every penny they could for a down payment for a house because that was part of their american dream. that meant that i had two outfits to wear every season. that was shameful because my school peers unrelentingly made fun of me for it. i experienced a great deal of shame for being poor and the child of immigrants. even when things became much easier financially, i never felt like i belonged.do you worry about money now?i do, occasionally. i'm a single woman and i earn a very good living, but you never know. i often worry that things could come crashing down at any moment. i'm certain that this is intergenerational trauma passed down through several generations. i try very hard to remember that i've got massive hustle in me and i will do whatever i have to do to take care of myself. no one can take away my education, intelligence, and talent. during covid, i worked like crazy, around the clock, and it took a very big emotional toll on me. i'm very good at what i do but when you are the instrument and you feel like you're slipping, it's pretty scary. i check my accounts several times a week to remind myself that i'm okay and will be okay.at what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?i became financially responsible for myself at 34, which is not that long ago. after graduate school and working as a psychologist in a hospital system, i decided to complete a four-year postgraduate program to become a psychoanalyst. my mother helped me during those years too. it would have been impossible to financially manage it all without her help. this is not spoken about much, at least in my experience, but becoming a psychologist and psychoanalyst takes many, many years (as it should) and it feels impossible for someone without privilege to do this. it needs to be said that the knowledge and experience i gained from that last psychoanalytic training program stepped my game up by many levels and allowed me to earn the kind of living i do today. because i had financial help, i was able to start a small private practice. if i needed money today i know that i could ask my mother but i wouldn't. i'd likely ask friends first.do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? if yes, please explain.i was financially supported throughout my education and early career. though it was not income, i did not earn that money. my sibling and i stand to inherit a fair amount of assets between us, but i do not think about this much. i plan to give whatever my entire share will be to my sibling. that's important to me.day one7 a.m. — i get up and walk my dogs. we stop at starbucks to pick up my almost daily four shots of espresso over ice ($3.54, and $1 tip). i adore this particular starbucks location. i've known the people who work there for years and they make my day. we walk until everyone's done their personal business and i've finished my coffee. we get home around 7:45 and i make breakfast — a bowl of greek yogurt with some peanut butter granola and a banana. i had that in the fridge. i do some basic grooming and get dressed and am in front of my computer to start work at 8:14. i go nonstop until 12:15. $4.5412:20 p.m. — i order in tacos to be delivered around 1. i'll have those for lunch and dinner ($37.34, includes tip, delivery fees, and whatever else ubereats charges for). i walk my dogs again and time it so that i pick the delivery up in my building lobby as the dogs and i are returning from our walk. i have two tacos for lunch and then scroll twitter for a bit. $37.341:40 p.m. — i suddenly remembered to go on amazon to order a pet vacuum that removes stains and deep cleans rugs and fabrics, as well as extra bottles of the cleaning solution ($156.74). i've been meaning to buy this for a while and today was that day. i'm going to steam clean my mattress and a small runner in my bedroom. i go back to work until 6:30. $156.747:30 p.m. — for dinner, i eat another taco and some leftover roasted veggies i have in my fridge. for dessert, i have hu kitchen chocolate gems that i buy at costco whenever i take a trip there. i feed and walk my dogs and am in bed by 9. scroll twitter until i fell asleep.daily

freezing out. i make breakfast at home — a cheddar and veggie omelet on two small coconut flour tortillas. i eat that and do some basic grooming before work. i work from 9 to 1. friday is my lightest day. $4.541:30 p.m. — after walking my dogs again, i'm hungry. i eat the two leftover tacos from yesterday for lunch. then, i take a long shower, scrub myself from head to toe with a japanese scrub towel, wash my hair twice, and feel so good. i do my full skin regimen. on my face, i splash some sk-ii pitera essence toner followed by a generous layer of lamer concentrate on my face and neck. once that absorbs, i usually follow that with a layer of sk-ii rna power face cream, but don't do that today. on my body, i use lelabo's body lotion in the noir. i also use that perfume but not today since the lotion is more than enough. i towel dry my hair, comb it, and scrunch a few dabs of oribe supershine cream into it. i neither wear makeup nor blow dry my hair, so that's that.5:15 p.m. — i head to a friend's house for dinner and bring a bottle of wine that came from my personal stash. i rarely drink wine because i don't really like it and it makes me feel hungover the next day in a way that i can't stand. i prefer simple drinks like vodka and gin with soda. but i always have several bottles of wine at home to offer guests or to bring with me if i'm the guest. i take the subway to my friend's house ($2.75) and get there around 5:45. we're all vaccinated now. we eat indoors together and hug for the first time in a long time. we also pop some edibles so within an hour i have my vibe right. that and a double vodka soda is perfect. so much fun. i take the train back around 10:30 ($2.75). walk my dogs and go to bed. $5.50daily total: $10.04day three8 a.m. — wake up, get dressed, and

others happy. $4.549:45 a.m. — i get back in bed to start an israeli show i've been meaning to watch called valley of tears. it's on hbo max. i then realize that i canceled my subscription many months

did you participate in any form of higher education? if yes, how did you pay for it?yes, growing up in a second/third-generation immigrant family, there was always a strong focus on education as *the* key to achievement in the u.s. my grandparents paid for all four of their children's college and higher education on store clerk salaries (a testament to the fact that a few decades ago, service jobs used to actually provide a living wage). with the combination of my parents and grandparents saving for my college education while i was growing up and in-state tuition to a state school, i graduated from college debt-free.growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? did your parent/guardian(s) educate you about finances?my parents always emphasized the importance of saving more than you spend, spending wisely, and being generous with money when it matters (particularly to support family and friends in need). they also made sure i was financially literate from a young age. they discussed budgeting, tax preparation, how credit cards work, etc. they never discussed exactly how much money they made, but just communicated that financially, we were ""comfortably middle class"" or ""upper-middle class."" in high school, my mom set up a credit card for me that she co-signed for so that i would begin to build credit.what was your first job and why did you get it?my first job was babysitting for my neighbors when i was a teenager. in retrospect, i was a pretty bad babysitter, but i guess the parents just appreciated the fact that i lived down the street and could be at their house on very short notice. the money i earned was entirely spending money for myself. at some point in high school, the expectation between myself and my parents became that they would pay for my groceries and shelter and i would pay for my own clothes, personal care, entertainment, etc.did you worry about money growing up?thankfully no. the most i ever remember being worried was during the 2007 – 2008 great recession. i was in middle school, but i heard (on the radio, news, school, etc.) about how the american middle class was being gutted and people were losing all of their savings. i distinctly remember asking my mom during a car ride what that meant for her and us. and her response was that her investment (e.g. her retirement, my college savings) accounts would be impacted, but that day-to-day, our lives were fine and we were a lot luckier than most.do you worry about money now?no. i'm incredibly lucky to be working at a high-paying job where i can save about as much as i spend.at what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?i became financially independent when i graduated college and started working an investment banking job. i was (and am still) on my parents' phone plan, but i direct deposit them quarterly for my portion of the bill.do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? if yes, please explain.no.day one8:30 a.m. — wake up and eat yogurt and make matcha tea for breakfast. today's president's day and because i'm off of work, i'm volunteering at a local food pantry/soup kitchen. i end up spending three hours packaging pecans and cookies into ~500 individual portions. this place serves around 700 meals to hungry and homeless new yorkers every weekday. since the covid-pandemic set in, they've been offering food ""to-go."" it takes an incredible amount of coordination from the staff and volunteers to make this happen every day.12:30 p.m. — the volunteers have lunch together after shift, which ends up being fish, rice, and veggies. delicious.1 p.m. — back home. i sign into my email, respond to a few things, and then take a nap.5 p.m. — after a relaxing, lazy afternoon, i decide to sign up for a 6:30 barre class ($37). i walk there and back. $378 p.m. — back home after barre, i heat up some leftovers i made over the weekend (salmon and pasta) and eat it with some chips and salsa.9 p.m. — tomorrow is one of my best friend's (p.) birthdays and i've forgotten to get her something. given that i haven't seen her in over a year (because of covid) and she lives in a different state, i feel like thoughtful birthday gifts are a nice way to share something tangible when everything else in our lives is virtual. i quickly scramble, text our other friend (n.) and we end up sending her some compartes chocolate for her birthday ($25 for my half). it'll end up arriving late, but p. isn't currently at home anyways so hopefully, it arrives before she gets back. $25daily total: $62day two9 a.m. — wake up and make a smoothie for breakfast. smoothies have been a cornerstone of my breakfast routine since high school (non-dairy unsweetened yogurt, frozen fruit, spinach, non-dairy milk, and whatever protein powders/seeds/oils my roommate l. or i have around).1 p.m. — my workplace is allowing us to expense meals while working from home, which is very generous. i seamless some roast chicken from a nearby gourmet grocery store ($18 with delivery cost and tip — expensed). i make a quick salad with mixed greens, avocado, macadamia nuts, and a dijon/apple cider vinegar/avocado oil dressing to eat with the chicken. ($18 expensed)2 p.m. — i work through the afternoon, trying to sneak bites of roasted edamame beans between zoom calls.9 p.m. — decide i'm done with work for the day, just in time to put on real pants and a little makeup before going out to dinner with my roommate, l. we both miss our pre-covid lives where we would go out and see big groups of friends regularly and realize it's going to be a long time before we are allowed to/feel comfortable to be hanging out with strangers at a crowded bar again. we agreed that we just need to spend more time and energy enjoying what we can in nyc, especially now that indoor dining just reopened. we snag a 9:30 reservation at an italian restaurant. thankfully, l. and i both love food and like to eat the same things, that's probably 70% of why we get along as roommates. the veal and tiramisu and vibes are phenomenal. i really missed sitting indoors at restaurants and people watching the other diners and servers and bartenders, so tonight feels great. l.. and i split the bill — $100.10 for my portion. $110.1011 p.m. — do 20 minutes of half-assed, slightly tipsy yoga before bed.daily total: $110.10day three9:30 a.m. — i go back and forth about whether or not i like working from home. i miss my cubicle space and being around other people while i work. but the one undeniable benefit is sleeping in every day. my first zoom call today isn't until 10, so i get to sleep in until 9:30. after answering a few quick emails, i make a matcha latte and change my nighttime pajamas into my marginally more professional daytime pajamas.11 a.m. — i order a breakfast sandwich for a weekday brunch. it's delicious even though i wolf it down in a few minutes between calls. ($24 expensed)1:30 p.m. — i have four straight hours of zoom after this, so i make a quick salad (just lettuce, oil, and vinegar) and get some water before sitting down again.4 p.m. — snack on some roasted edamame that i drunkenly purchased on amazon but are actually pretty good.7 p.m. — going to be working late tonight, so i order dinner. i get some vegan dry pot from a chinese restaurant. ($32.25 expensed)11:30 p.m. — finally done with work. i think work culture during the pandemic has overall gotten worse because items that used to be handled by quickly popping into someone's office for ten minutes now take at least 30 minutes of back and forth over email. i manage to sign off and quickly get ready for bed.daily total: $0day four8:50 a.m. — roll out of bed, wash my face and throw on a collared shirt before my 9 a.m. zoom meeting. it's supposed to snow all day in new york.10 a.m. — two meetings/calls down. i make a matcha latte and smoothie (today it's mango, pineapple, almond yogurt, collagen powder, and flax milk).1 p.m. — eat my leftover dry pot and cook some mushrooms for lunch.3 p.m. — one of my prized possessions in life/most ridiculous purchase is my philips sonicare diamondclean toothbrush. it was unreasonably expensive but has a ton of features that i actually use, namely an app that tracks how often i brush my teeth and areas of my mouth i tend to miss. it also lets me know if i'm brushing with too much pressure or going too quickly. i fully realize that these features are unnecessary, but believe me when i say they changed my life. i'm out of replacement heads so i buy some on amazon. $48.567 p.m. — i roast the last of my veggies from my latest misfits markets box — some butternut squash and two red potatoes. i like misfits and i generally choose the components of my box ahead of time. but the quantity of each fruit/veggie is always a surprise to me. sometimes i'll get two potatoes, sometimes i'll get one carrot, sometimes i'll get six beets. you really never know. l. and i eat the veggies with some salad for dinner.8 p.m. — after dinner, i take a break to relax on the couch and watch netflix before doing one last hour of work.10 p.m. — feeling a little achy from sitting all day, so i do 30 minutes of yoga with the down dog app before bed.12 a.m. — accidentally fall into an instagram/tiktok hole instead of showering and getting ready for bed. whoops.daily total: $48.56day five8:30 a.m. — i have a three-hour zoom this morning so i wake up early enough to fully get ready and eat breakfast before starting my day.10 a.m. — i get a reminder email about a friend's virtual baby shower in a few weeks. she has a registry, but most of the items have been purchased so i send an amazon gift card so she and her husband can buy whatever they need. $20012 p.m. — l. makes pasta and veggies for lunch for both of us.6 p.m. — grocery store to get supplies for a dinner i'm having with a few friends at my apartment tonight. we're a ""pod"" that has been hanging out together for months at this point. we're essentially having a cheese plate for dinner. i also get some groceries for the week. i buy crackers, several kinds of cheese including vegan cheese (shoutout miyoko brand), olives, sweet jarred peppers, raspberries, spinach, cucumbers, bell peppers, limes, topo chico mineral water, oat milk, noodles, and pasta. $69.928 p.m. — my friends (n. and s. plus l.) show up and we set up our cheese board and pop open some sparkling wine. love this group, i can already tell it's going to be a long night of eating, drinking, chatting, and listening to music. i very much miss going out to bars and meeting new people, but hanging out with this group on the weekends makes me very happy. and i know i will never again take for granted hanging out in a bar at 2 a.m.1:30 a.m. — my friends leave and i clean up. thankfully, our apartment has a dishwasher so i can pretty much put everything in there and figure out the rest tomorrow.daily total: $269.92day six10 a.m. — wake up with a hangover and stomachache, honestly the cheese and wine last night was still worth it. i'm going back home to my parents' house today outside of the city, so i get up and go to penn station.11 a.m. — i am a little worried about taking the train, but it ends up being a pretty normal experience. it's not very crowded so i get a section to myself, show my e-ticket to the conductor, and settle in. my ticket costs $19.50 for a round-trip. $19.5012 p.m. — my mom picks me up from the train station and we head to one of our favorite restaurants to pick up lunch. she orders pasta, a pizza, and a few soups/sides. i run inside to get the food and pay. $59.9312:30 p.m. — we drive to my grandma's apartment to eat. i'm excited to see her because we're pretty close but haven't been able to see each other as much since the onset of the pandemic. she's also technologically challenged and pretty deaf, so speaking to her on the phone or via facetime can be challenging. she is recently fully vaccinated, and while we still keep our distance (wear masks when we aren't actively eating, don't hug), knowing that she's vaccinated makes me feel much safer about seeing her in person. she also gives me a whole fish to take home that she prepared my favorite way (a belated-lunar new year gift, sort of). i'm a little worried about how to transport it back home, but my mom does that mom-magic thing where she manages to get it into a sealed tupperware and wrap it in a bag so it won't smell on the hour-plus trip back home.4 p.m. — time for me to go back home. my mom drops me off at the train station. i'm very sleepy after lunch and doze off a little on the train.6 p.m. — at home, i make a quick dinner — noodles with veggies and the fish from my grandma.8 p.m. — l. and i watch old episodes of new girl and relax on the couch for the night.daily total: $79.43day seven10 a.m. — i signed up for a morning solidcore workout and it's with my favorite instructor. i love solidcore and think it's truly the hardest workout class that i've tried yet. i'm always very sore the next day. it's also very doable with a mask on because the workout is entirely comprised of small push-pull movements versus cardio. i previously purchased a package of classes for solidcore, but right now each class is ~$40 to purchase individually.11 a.m. — confirmed i'm barely able to walk out of class. i head to a nearby coffee shop for a chai tea latte. my favorite barista is there and it's not very busy so we chat for a little before i head out to the park to enjoy my latte around the company of dogs and families. $611:30 a.m. — i take the long way home and stop by a cute bookstore. i end up picking up a copy of my year abroad by chang-rae lee. it ends up being a signed copy which is pretty cool. $30.4912 p.m. — home, i make some eggs with spinach, butternut squash, and roasted garlic and a sandwich with leftover cheese, peppers, and veggies.1 p.m. — i take a shower and do a full skincare/haircare routine including hair mask, skin mask, and exfoliation.3 p.m. — i see an ad for pura, which is a bluetooth-enabled plug-in scent diffuser. the reviews look great and they've partnered with some great fragrance brands to create scents. i've been looking for a good alternative to candles for a while now so i decide to buy it and try it out. i buy the device as well as three scents. $78.187:15 p.m. — take the subway to meet a friend, d., for dinner near where he lives uptown. i haven't taken the subway very much since the onset of the pandemic, but i am starting to feel more comfortable doing this again. $2.757:30 p.m. — meet d. uptown. the restaurant is pretty much empty so we feel comfortable sitting indoors. we get drinks and share a bunch of turkish food including flatbread, zucchini fritters, salad, lamb, and manti. d. and i have hooked up in the past and sometimes i feel like we have weird ~vibes~. i'm not interested in ~seeing~ him right now so i insist on splitting the bill and casually let him know i'm taking a lyft home. $73.269:30 p.m. — as promised, i take a lyft home. already feeling sore from solidcore this morning so i wash up, get ready for bed, and brace myself for another work week starting tomorrow. $15.11daily total: $205.79"

did you participate in any form of higher education? if yes, how did you pay for it?yes, it wasn't an option. neither of my parents went to college and were adamant about us getting some sort of higher education. my brother ended up going into the military instead, but my agreement with my parents was that they would pay for my loans once i graduated. that didn't work out because my dad passed when i was 20, so my husband and i are aggressively paying down our student loan debt.growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? did your parent/guardian(s) educate you about finances?my parents didn't teach me anything about money, which i'm a little bitter about now. my parents observed pretty traditional gender roles; my mom was a stay-at-home mom and my dad was the primary breadwinner and took care of all the finances. turns out my dad was awful with money and they were in a ton of debt that no one knew about until he died, and my mom and i had to learn how to handle money together. we always had the best and the newest of everything: cars, technology, clothes, etc… so i guess, if anything, they taught me that it's much better to be financially stable with less of a focus on material things than it is to be drowning in debt with no transparency about finances in your relationship.what was your first job and why did you get it?i worked as a server for cash at a pizza place that my dad's friend owned when i was 14. it was a fun, after-school and weekend job, but my first legal job was at kmart (lmao midwest life).did you worry about money growing up?not really. even when my dad wasn't working due to surgeries, i wasn't aware of any issues.do you worry about money now?a lot more than i probably should. we're doing okay, but my parents' situation kind of traumatized me, so i'm always hyper-aware of our finances. i think once we have our student debt paid off, i'll feel much better.at what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?when i moved out at 23. i was working full time and going to school full time (yes, it was as exhausting as it sounds), so my mom kept me on her health insurance which was amazing, but i was responsible for paying for everything other than that. we don't have a safety net other than ourselves because while we could ask either of our families for help if we needed it, no one is in a situation that makes it really feasible.do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? if yes, please explain.i haven't. my dad committed suicide, and we only got $25,000 from the life insurance company. it went toward funeral expenses and getting my mom back on her feet. while i haven't received passive or inherited income, my brother and sil did let my mom and i live with them for a couple of years after my dad passed. my grandma also cosigned on my private student loans because my parents' credit wasn't good enough and i wouldn't have been able to continue my education without that. without the help from my family in these regards, i wouldn't be where i am, and i think it's important to acknowledge that!day one6:30 a.m. — wake up and lay in bed for an hour instead of working out like i intended to do, oops. after a shower, i make a brown sugar shaken espresso with oat milk because i keep seeing people talk about the starbucks one. i get screamed at by our three cats to be fed and then feed myself some oats while starting my workday.12 p.m. — it's been one of those days. i mean, it's wednesday, so it makes sense, but i'm ready for it to be over. while i'm making my lunch (read: heating up a leftover baked potato and peeling an orange), i make soft boiled eggs in the instant pot. they'll be marinated in some soy sauce and mirin to go in our ramen for dinner tonight. i got diagnosed with binge eating disorder last month and i'm working with my therapist to recognize unhealthy thoughts around food, so i jot down some notes to talk to her about this week.3 p.m. — my friend, a., comes over to do a mock therapy session for one of her social work classes. she's one of the few people i trust is as careful as my husband and i are about covid, and she's vaccinated which is comforting too. we finish up our session and then chat for an hour or so.6 p.m. — m. (my husband) and i hang out in the kitchen while prepping dinner. it's nothing fancy, just ramen packets that we're prettying up with enoki and shitake mushrooms, the eggs i made earlier, and some bok choy! we went vegetarian in early december and have been having a really fun time cooking together. once our bowls are assembled, we walk right past our beautiful dining room table to eat on the couch and watch a couple of episodes of the blacklist.9:30 p.m. — time for bed! m. is a night owl and i require nine hours to function, so he goes into our shared office to play pc games while i start a sleep meditation on the calm app and beckon my favorite cat to come snuggle me.daily total: $0day two8 a.m. — my morning goes about the same as yesterday. i lay in bed instead of working out because i'm exhausted despite getting nine hours… turns out my period is looming so i make a mental note to sanitize my menstrual cup. m. got a vasectomy in august because we are happily childfree and intend to stay that way, so i got my iud removed once he got the all-clear that his procedure worked. i've had pcos since i was 15 and got put on birth control immediately, so before october 2020, i had only had a couple of natural periods in my life and they were irregular. it's a huge pcos win to have natural, regular periods without medication so we celebrate menstruation in this house (typically with donuts).12 p.m. — wrap up a morning of work and make lunch. i have another pack of ramen with the leftover bok choy and the last marinated egg. there's something so comforting about packaged ramen and i'm willing to die on that hill. when i'm done eating, i feed my sourdough starter.4 p.m. — log off for the day and start a sourdough focaccia dough. my sourdough starter is nice and bubbly and it makes me feel nostalgic for the bread-making/dalgona coffee/tiger king part of quarantine. m. convinces me to run to home depot with him. we need to build some sort of shelter for our seedlings or our cats will absolutely eat them, so we get chicken wire, wood, hinges, and other things i don't pay attention to because i have to be dragged away from the plant section. $64.056 p.m. — we grab taco bell on the way home and complain about how bleak being a vegetarian and eating here has become. soon, we will be reunited with our precious potatoes. when we get home, we turn on the blacklist while eating and end up watching three episodes. i get my focaccia dough shaped, put it in the fridge, and head to bed. m. has the day off tomorrow so he heads to our office to play games. $13.45daily total: $77.50day three8 a.m. — m. gets paid today so i look at our budget spreadsheet and pay the expenses allocated to his check. we set up our cart yesterday with groceries for the next week, so all i have to do this morning is checkout and schedule the delivery from aldi via instacart ($79.59). before i jump into work, i gather up m.'s request for pods and place a nespresso order ($88). i also get a recycling bag because one of the main reasons we were comfortable getting a nespresso (we have the next model) was their robust recycling program! $167.5912 p.m. — after emerging from meetings, i find m. in the garage building the seedling cage so we can figure out lunch. i have no patience for cooking and i'm going to be in meetings again soon, so we order chipotle. we really have a tendency to ball out on paydays and then live pretty frugally otherwise, but we're both fine with it! $33.416:30 p.m. — after laying on the couch for a bit, i decide to eat the rest of my chipotle bowl for dinner while m. plays online games with his friends. we're both introverts, so we fully embrace and appreciate the ""alone together"" time that we get while doing our own things in the house.daily total: $201day four7:20 a.m. — i'm immediately annoyed that i'm awake this early on a saturday, but here we are. after flopping around for a bit, i take a bath. a maple iced latte is the bathtub drink of choice today and our smallest cat lovingly dips her paw into it right before nearly falling in the tub.11 a.m. — our groceries get here so we put them away and share a snack of chips and dip. now feels like a good time to start planting, so we start our herbs and peppers. we're a big spreadsheet household, so i made a sheet a couple weeks ago to track what needs to be started or transplanted and when. the rest of our garden is set to be sown next weekend. while we're in a gardening mood, i convince m. to come out and turn the compost with me. some of the soil is still frozen, so we take turns breaking it up in hopes that the nice weather will get our box nice and hot!6:30 p.m. — i've been on a hunt for vegan protein powder that isn't disgusting or $100 a tub for what feels like hours, but i give up to make breakfast for dinner. eggs, morningstar sausage, and fried potatoes while we watch… you guessed it, blacklist.9:40 p.m. — we have not moved from the couch and i'm here for it. still putting in work on our show and multitasking by researching protein powder again. i end up deciding to order some sample packs of orgain because they're on sale on amazon and we canceled our membership, so it feels like a solid last purchase. $20daily total: $20day five8:30 a.m. — wake up to a cat screaming in my face, so i laze around in bed while scrolling on my phone. i check our banking app and see that my check came through, so i force myself out of bed to make another brown sugar shaken espresso with oat milk (i know how douchey that sounds, i promise) and head to our office to pay bills. m. is already hanging out in here, so we chat about our current financial situation over coffee. our ""allowances"" are part of this check, so we each get $150 transferred to our ""fun"" accounts that give us carte blanche spending money. it's eliminated nearly every issue we had re: money and gives us both freedom to not have to clear purchases with the other!11:15 a.m. — i convince myself to do a 15-minute hiit ride on our myx bike, and it kicks my ass. i did crossfit pre-pandemic so the shift from lifting heavy to doing mostly cardio and moderate strength training has been interesting. that being said, i've really enjoyed it and i can do it at home and feel safe which is most important to me right now. m. is in the garage when i come back upstairs, so i jump in the shower. i think i'm more hungry than i am, so i make french toast sticks and morningstar sausage in the air fryer, but only eat half. this makes me appear to be a great wife when m. comes in and i tell him i ""saved"" the rest for him.6:30 p.m. — we convene in the kitchen to make barbecue tofu and baked potatoes. once everything is done, we head to the couch like the disgusting creatures of habit we are to cram as many episodes of blacklist as we can into our eyeballs before i go to bed around 9:45.daily total: $0day six8:45 a.m. — my company has flexible hours, so i lay in bed a little bit longer this morning by negotiating with myself that i can log into work later as long as i work out. i take a banana to my desk with me and eat it while catching up on emails and the never-ending slack notifications. still hungry after my banana, so i make some toast with butter.11:45 a.m. — i chop up a carrot and bell pepper that are going to go bad and cook them with some boca crumbles while boiling some udon. the last of the peanut butter jar gets shaken with chili garlic sauce, soy sauce, rice vinegar, and sesame oil for a quick peanut sauce. toss everything together and top with green onions before heading back to my desk. i don't eat all my noodles so i pack up the rest and put them in the fridge. one of my things i'm trying to focus on re: binge eating recovery is that i *can* have things later. i don't have to eat it all because it's in front of me, which is a new concept for someone who grew up in a huge portion and clean plate club household.6 p.m. — m. sits on the kitchen counter while i shape falafel from a mix and put them into the air fryer. i made some tzatziki earlier today so once the falafel is done, all we have to do is heat up some pita and dress our salads! we chat about the garden and start a to-do list of things we can start getting ready this week since it's supposed to be gorgeous. eat dinner while we watch blacklist, the usual. i go to bed around 9 but don't end up actually falling asleep until 11, oops.daily total: $0day seven8:15 a.m. — sit down at my desk with a chocolate fudge coffee (my least favorite nespresso pod, but we have four pods left and they are all this flavor lol).10 a.m. — i throw together a quick egg sandwich with sriracha and morningstar bacon on it and head back to my desk. today is a little chaotic because tomorrow we have a sprint day, so my sandwich comes with a side of code.12:15 p.m. — i needed a mental break and that involves physically stepping away from my desk so i can come back with fresh eyes. i decide to hop on the bike for a 30-minute interval ride and i absolutely love it. i normally struggle with hard rides in the morning so maybe that's a sign to stop trying to force myself to work out at specific times and be more flexible! i take a quick shower and make my way back to my desk.4 p.m. — log off for the day and chat with m. while we unload and reload the dishwasher. he talked to my brother today about borrowing a ladder, so once we're done with the dishes and some other chores (cleaning litter boxes, taking the trash out, and picking up the house), we go grab the ladder.6:30 p.m. — we're both tired so we settle on pasta with meatless meatballs for dinner. i throw a couple of slices of garlic bread in the air fryer while m. makes dinner. when we're done eating, m. places an order for the rest of the garden tools we'll need. we should be able to get the raised beds put together this weekend and i am so so excited!

as a teenager, my mom just basically gave me what i asked for (obviously within reason).do you worry about money now?yes, all the time. at the start of the pandemic, my $60,000 salary was taken away and we were all given $15/hour. i was on partial unemployment until the first reopening last june. when we reopened, i was offered $20/hour, which i negotiated to $25/hour at the height of a very busy summer. i used to work 10-12 hours a day as a salaried employee, but now i only work six to eight hours a day and bring in roughly $45,000 a year. it's been a big hit for me because i have some big bills, such as my very expensive health insurance (which most restaurant people i know don't have). thankfully, my rent is not bad.at what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?up until age 25, i was living rent-free at home. i moved out with my then-boyfriend and that's when i became fiscally independent. i do have a decent amount in savings and retirement i could tap if needed, and my boyfriend definitely came through last year chipping in more for the monthly expenses (his job was unaffected by the pandemic and he makes more money than i do). i could also rely on my mom for help if needed.do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? if yes, please explain.several years ago my mom gifted me $10,000 after the sale of a building and i put it in a mutual fund. i have occasionally taken out some money to travel, then not touched it to let it grow again.day one8 a.m. — i arrive at work, put some ice cream base on the stove to start cooking, then sit down with a bowl of honey nut cheerios and a double espresso. the perks of being the boss, i can have breakfast as soon as i get to work. today is sunday and we have brunch service, so it will be a busy day. our general manager gets in after my breakfast and since she is one of my best friends, we spend 15 minutes reviewing the gossip of the last few days. restaurants are full of gossip, all the time, and she knows all of it (as a good gm should). i take a low dose of xanax (prescribed to me) because busy sundays make my heart race.4 p.m. — at the end of my sunday brunch shift, i always sit down with our gm for an amaro and more gossip; we call it amaro clock. the gossip today is about trying to replace our chef de cuisine and sous chef at the same time, no good at all.5:30 p.m. — since i've already spent a long day cooking other people's food, i hate to come home and cook on sunday nights. i stop at a jersey mike's and get sandwiches ($20.20 with tip). i get home and my boyfriend, s., and i unwind with bourbons (with a splash of my favorite amaro in mine, restaurant people love bitter aperitifs) and music and talk about our days. we watch schitt's creek with dinner (after he rejects the headlines on 60 minutes, we are old) and i am sad we are almost done with the series. $20.208:30 p.m. — get into bed because i have to open the restaurant tomorrow and have to wake up at 4:15 a.m. i am currently rewatching dexter and it takes me about two episodes to actually fall asleep. s. stays up grading papers and playing video games in the living room. he teaches from home and literally never leaves the house, i have no idea how he can stand it.daily total: $20.20day two4:15 a.m. — 4:15 is deeply horrible. no matter how much i do it, there is nothing natural about getting up in the middle of the night. i get up, read the nightly email from the restaurant, and scroll instagram for a few minutes before turning on the shower. my cat and i have a ritual where i lay back down in bed for the five minutes it takes the shower to heat up and she sits on my chest for pets until she gets tired of it and tries to bite me. at 5 a.m., i'm off!7:30 a.m. — once the pastry case in the cafe is fully stocked, i can finally relax with some cheerios and espresso. we are out of strawberries for my cereal but i remember there is leftover farmer's market strawberry compote from a dessert special and spoon the whole runny, jammy mess into my bowl. i applaud myself for my cheffyness. also there is now bonus strawberry milk left at the bottom of the bowl.12 p.m. — lunch! you would think working in a restaurant would give you a lot of lunch options, but you just end up tired of all the food, even the food hacks where you frankenstein the various components into new dishes. our gm and i keep a variety of frozen foods on hand that are quick to make, so today i settle on a few chicken tenders (easy access to a fryer is magical), some bagel chips, and my house-made ranch for dipping. always ranch. after lunch, i make an ice cream base and some little frozen mousses for dinner service. even though i hate hate hate opening, it's better than closing and gets me home early in the day.2:30 p.m. — i get home just as s. is finishing a zoom class. we chat about our days and he laughs this kind of wheezy laugh and stops and asks me if i remember an old cartoon dog with a laugh like that. yes, i do and his name is muttley. he is an old hanna-barbera cartoon and the sidekick to dick dastardly. s. makes me spend the next half hour watching muttley on youtube and trying to perfect his muttley laugh. he hurts himself a little. i spend the rest of the afternoon reading both newspapers i subscribe to, eater la and buzzfeed, then taking a well-deserved nap with the cat.5:30 p.m. — time to start thinking about dinner. i pour us some bourbon and pull up the smitten kitchen recipe for baked pasta with sausage and broccoli raab, it's s.'s favorite. after the pasta, s. eats a cookie i brought home from work and i eat...a piece of parmesan. here is the worst thing about me: i'm a pastry chef and i don't really like sweets. but give me a piece of good cheese and a few olives after dinner and i am in hog heaven. a walk around the neighborhood, then more schitt's creek, then bed and dexter at 8:30.daily total: $0day three4:15 a.m. — just. the. absolute. worst. i have to open the restaurant three days a week now and it honestly never gets easier.10:30 a.m. — after a morning spent making muffin batter, ice cream, and sponge cake, i lean under the station to get something and somehow knock over a sanitizer bucket right into my shoe. my pants and socks are soaking wet and i briefly consider just giving up and going home.11:30 a.m. — our chef and owner comes in to do some r&d and it's nice to see them. they set up to work on the table next to me so i get to have little tastes. our chef is very famous and isn't here very often. (celebrity chefs do not cook in their restaurants.) i'm glad i didn't leave even though i am still squishing in my shoes. i bake off a few of my new cookies and they love it, and i am very happy.2:30 p.m. — i get home and s. is still talking about muttley. i decide i am going to buy him a stuffed muttley, figuring i can find a vintage one, but i go online and discover that because he was in a strange movie called scoob! last year, amazon sells stuffed muttleys! i snap one up and keep it a secret from s. $13.835:30 p.m. — bourbon and amaro and dinner time. i've been super into french onion soup lately (smitten kitchen recipe again), and when i make it there's always leftovers that i freeze so i barely have to do any prep tonight. i pair it with a quick salad. i top the toast on the soup with about twice as much gruyere as is advisable, and the cheese pull is phenomenal. s. eats the ice cream i brought home from work and i have a stick of juicy fruit gum, another favorite dessert. we eat, watch jeopardy, go for a quick walk, watch some schitt's creek, then i am in bed early so i can wake from the dead one more time tomorrow.daily total: $13.83day four4:15 a.m. — ugh.8:30 a.m. — one of our cooks urgently calls me into the other room, so i hurry over. i find three people standing around a tub of something that looks like jam, jiggles like jam, smells like jam, and is labeled ""jam."" they want to know if it is jam. i consider going home.1 p.m. — lunch with our gm. the days we work together are all about lunch. today, it is a frozen amy's cheese pizza, which i top with good olive oil, sliced pepperoncini, and pineapple (come at me). we obviously dip our crusts in ranch. we toast to our own lunch brilliance and gossip some more on the patio.2:30 p.m. — get home and flop on the couch to work on my cookbook. a friend is setting up a meeting for me with a culinary book packager. i spend some time working on the main introduction and on recipe introductions. i compile my own photos and daydream about a book full of big glossy photographs.5:30 p.m. — s. has a zoom meeting with his family while i get started on dinner. before you accuse him of not pulling his weight, he is not allowed to cook. when i met him, he was eating quesadillas filled with granola. i make yet another smitten kitchen recipe (i owe her everything) of tomato sausage risotto (if you're looking up the recipe, i add a small box of basil to it and it makes a world of difference). i have to balance what i make during the week because s. needs leftovers for lunch since he works from home, but i don't want to end up with too many leftovers because i will not eat them (leftovers are gross except for pizza and thanksgiving). this will make a few days of leftovers and s. eats them happily. jeopardy, evening walk, and bed a little later than usual because i get to sleep in tomorrow!!daily total: $0day five6:45 a.m. — sleeping until 6:45 is blissful.8 a.m. — get to work, and it's ice cream spinning day! i get myself all set up to run the machine, then have breakfast of scrambled egg, hash browns, and espresso. i get started spinning, and while the ice cream spins, i do the dishes. one of the worst consequences of the pandemic is that we no longer have a daytime dishwasher and it is terrible. with four to six people working in the kitchen, you have to stay on top of the dishes or you are sunk. we all hate it.12 p.m.— lunch with the gm is the good snappy hot dogs from the butcher shop that i throw in the fryer to cook.1 p.m. — one of my favorite specialty vendors who is also a good friend comes in under the pretense of trying some new vanillas. we gossip for two hours on the patio and taste vanilla for about ten minutes (did i tell you restaurants are built on gossip?). she works for an independent purveyor who is obviously struggling right now and i try to source as many things as possible from her.4:30 p.m. — i get home, grateful it is my friday, and muttley has arrived. i tell s. to close his eyes and put out his hands and i hand him muttley. he is over the moon and shows off his muttley laugh. then the three of us watch some cartoons.7 p.m. — tonight is pizza night and we order a salad and a large pizza ($43.81, s. pays). i get veggies on my half and s. complains that it's too slimy when he eats it leftover. but he eats it anyway. i bring home s. a piece of carrot cake and i have...another slice of pizza for dessert? i would like to tell you that when i don't have to get up the next day, i go to bed late, but once you're used to going to bed early, you can't stop. i take a sleeping pill so i don't accidentally wake up early, and it is bliss.daily total: $0day six9 a.m. — sleep in! i wake up, make coffee, read emails and scroll instagram, then start working on my grocery shopping list. it's a task i love. i meal plan for the whole week and only go shopping once a week.10:30 a.m. — off to the grocery store. i get the basics here, then shop elsewhere for specialty items. among other things, i get four roses bourbon, canned salmon as a treat for the cat, svedka vodka and tomato juice for bloody marys, hickory chips for the grill (hooked on hickory), cheddar for burgers, and the prep for chilaquiles, pad see ew, cassoulet, and baked potato soup ($110.36, split with s.). $55.1811:30 a.m. — head over to the original farmer's market at third and fairfax. i love using the vendors there and shopping local for the fancy stuff and quality meat. from the butcher i get sausages for the cassoulet, flank steak for the pad see ew, and burgers to grill tonight ($24.50, split with s.). i get a baguette ($4.50, split), and go wild in the cheese shop for our weekly friday lunch. i get a soft cheese (brillat savarin), a hard cheese (beaufort), a blue (fourme d'ambert), proscuitto, and castelvetrano olives ($38.70, split). $33.8512 p.m. — after shopping, i hit the seafood restaurant there for my favorite weekly treat: oysters! i get six oysters on the half shell and slowly, quietly slurp them down. it is heavenly. i would get a dozen but $50 on something that is barely a snack is hard to justify. $24.9012:30 p.m. — get home, put away groceries, start a load of laundry ($2.25) and then finally settle in for a bloody mary with allll the garnishes and some reading. i am reading dr. carl hart's drug use for grown-ups and it is a clear-headed and very different approach; the drug policies in this country are offensive. lunch is a groaning board of the baguette, meat and cheeses, and tomatoes and peppers. after this weekly lunch, we have a family agreement to pass out in our respective spots (me, couch, s., bed). i put on the conjuring 2 and quickly fall asleep. i take horror movie naps, and yes, the screaming wakes me up. $2.257 p.m. — it is grilling time! s. sets up our little weber grill behind the apartment and i make homemade onion rings. we top our burgers with barbecue sauce and an onion ring and it is *chef's kiss*. i always have to remember to buy beer for s. because he apparently cannot run the grill without a beer? schitt's creek, dexter, sleeping pill, bed.daily total: $116.18day seven9 a.m. — blissful as always to sleep in. i have coffee, look at emails and instagram, and text a friend about coming over later for bloody marys. i got covid at work at the end of january (i started having symptoms the morning after a negative test, so word to the wise about using negative tests as a free pass to see people maskless) so i figure i have the immunity to sit on the front lawn having drinks from six feet away with a friend (s. will stay inside; he somehow managed to not catch covid from me). i get a second cup of coffee and manage to book an appointment for the vaccine! our area just opened up for food service workers to get it and i am very excited. even if it has a microchip in it.12 p.m. — every saturday we get sandwiches from my friend's cafe. this week i get the best cheesesteak in the city and s. gets a chicken laffa wrap. we watch an old episode of the simpsons while we eat. i pine for a nap but my friend is on his way. $351:30 p.m. — bloody marys on the front lawn with my best friend! it's nice to feel slightly normal.5:30 p.m. — pour a bourbon and start the prep for chilaquiles. i make the sauce and the tortilla chips from scratch. we top them with eggs, crema, oaxaca cheese, and guacamole and are suitably stuffed after. we take a long walk, then schitt's creek, and then time to get ready for another busy sunday brunch tomorrow.daily total: $35"

you to attend higher education? did you participate in any form of higher education? if yes, how did you pay for it?yes, i absolutely felt pressure to go to school. i'm the oldest of my parents' three children so i feel like there's always been a lot expected of me. both of my parents got their bachelor's degrees in their late 30's and made a very big deal of it. my siblings and i attended their ceremony, and we had a huge party and were so proud of them. i did two years at a local community college to get my aa and then transferred to a four-year university to get my bachelor's in healthcare administration. i was very fortunate because my father is a disabled veteran, so my entire education was paid for and i received a monthly stipend to help cover my living costs. i also did well enough in high school to receive a scholarship, so i was honestly banking over $1,000 a month while i was in school. this is a really big reason i never dropped out because i would lose these benefits if i did not complete my degree. i was not passionate about school at all and my program was extremely boring. i was a very mediocre student and graduated with a 3.3 gpa.growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? did your parent/guardian(s) educate you about finances?my parents talked to me about money, but i also paid really close attention to my parents' financial habits. my father has bipolar disorder and could be a bit erratic with his spending, but my mother was very stable and more levelheaded in her decision-making. between the two of them, i ended up with a really good understanding of the importance of saving money. however, i did have to teach myself how to finance a car, re-finance a car, do my taxes, etc. i do remember getting a small allowance when i was a child if i did my assigned chores. my father also started a savings fund for all three of us to use for college but by the time we made it to college-age that money was gone. my parents had a nasty divorce when i was 19 and i'm sure the money disappeared during that time.what was your first job and why did you get it?my first job was sonic as a carhop. they made me skate on every shift. yikes. falling was not fun, especially with a tray full of milkshakes. my parents encouraged me to get a job so that i could pay for my own gas and car insurance. they purchased me a red pt cruiser when i turned 16. i also think they stopped giving me an allowance at this point, so i had to pay for any social activities myself.did you worry about money growing up?not at all. if my parents went through any financial hardships, i was not made aware of it. it was always very important to my father that we seem wealthy. we lived in a small town in the south growing up and social status was a big deal. we always lived in big houses (my dad called them mcmansions) and had nice cars. when i look back now, everything that was important to my father was very superficial and we truly were not as wealthy as i thought we were at the time. but we never needed for anything. we took a lot of trips as well and my parents even bought my childhood best friend a season pass to six flags in atlanta so she could come on our family trips with us.do you worry about money now?yes and no. it definitely does not constantly consume my thoughts, but i try to be mindful about our savings account and like to keep it as full as possible. we used to only give ourselves a $100 a month allowance for extra stuff, but we've been bad about sticking to that lately. i am a little worried about j.'s work situation because we do not know how long his current internship will last.at what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?i became completely financially responsible for myself when j. and i moved in together when i was 20. i was mostly responsible for myself at 18 but still lived with my mom rent-free after my parents' divorce. we view our savings as a safety net, but if we were ever in complete financial distress my mother and stepdad would help us. we've never had to ask for support though and we would prefer to avoid that. we enjoy being self-sufficient!do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? if yes, please explain.nope and not expecting any either.day one4:50 a.m. — it's monday! my alarm goes off and i wake up to pee and eat a banana protein muffin as a pre-workout snack. i did a lot of cooking and baking this weekend so when i open the fridge, i am very happy to see how full it is. my husband, j., struggles in the morning, so i leave him in bed with the dog for an extra 10 minutes.5:40 a.m. — after we're both awake and ready, we head to the gym. my calves are really tight today from a six-mile run yesterday so i opt to do a back, arms, and abs workout today. i've been using the fit body app for around three years now and love having an easy program to follow.7:45 a.m. — once we are back from the gym, j. and i shower and get dressed for the day. we work on getting our breakfasts ready and talk about how he is not looking forward to his day. last week, he had to put in over 60 hours of work and he is exhausted. our dog decides to get sick in the kitchen while i'm plating up my breakfast (yuck). i eat breakfast, which today is two blueberry protein pancakes with some peanut butter, two eggs, two egg whites, and fresh raspberries. i brush my teeth, then head to work.12:15 p.m. — time for my lunch! i always take a 15-minute walk around the neighborhood behind my office and call j. to check in. we are a bit stressed because he found out today his paid internship will probably end in may. although we can survive on my income, it is not ideal. j. lets me know that the dog seems to be doing fine. no more accidents in the house. i head back to my office and warm up some leftover asparagus soup and toast two pieces of whole-grain bread. i watch gilmore girls on my phone while i eat.2 p.m. — i decide to go ahead and order j.'s anniversary gift. we have our five-year wedding anniversary next month. we were supposed to be spending it in japan, but thanks to covid, we had to cancel and will be spending the weekend in st. augustine. i ordered him a skate box because he loves skateboarding but never wants to go to the park by himself. i'm nervous and really hope he likes it. i check with his best friend and he says it seems like a good one. $1994:50 p.m. — i start wrapping up my work for the day and eat a quick snack. i have a red delicious apple and a handful of trail mix. i got pretty busy in the afternoon, so i am ready to head home to snuggle j. and the doggy.5:20 p.m. — i get home and we take the dog for a walk and she gets sick twice again, so we go ahead and call her vet to see what they think. they tell us we can drop her off first thing tomorrow morning. during the walk, j. and i talk more about his job prospects if his internship ends in may and he decides he needs to get started on redoing his portfolio so he can apply to different firms.6:30 p.m. — we get back home and j. heads upstairs to get started on his portfolio while i work on dinner. i make a tempeh stir fry.8 p.m. — we eat dinner and get all the dishes cleaned and put away. i take the dog out and she gets sick again. really glad i'm dropping her off at the vet

again. really really starting to worry about her at this point. i head back up to bed and fall asleep after tossing and turning for a bit.4:50 a.m. — i wake up and j. actually gets out of bed on the first alarm. i am shocked. i try to talk him into a rest day because my calves are still tight, but he wants to go to the gym, so i decide to tough it out. i eat another protein banana muffin and take the dog out so she can be sick again. hoping she does not get sick in the house while we're at the gym.5:40 a.m. — we head out for the gym. i'm planning to do a pretty intense leg day today if my

the day.9:30 a.m. — i call expedia to rebook a flight for my good friend's wedding next month in california. the flight schedules are a nightmare since covid, so i've had to rebook this flight a

head out for my lunchtime walk and call j. to check in. he's not in great spirits today and thinks he'll have to skip our walks and the gym for the rest of the week because his homework load just grew

going to is just a couple hours away from my mom and sister, so i'll go spend a couple days with them after the wedding.6 p.m. — we get back from our walk and i head to publix to pick up our weekly groceries. i also stop by the atm and grab $200 because i'm getting a tattoo tomorrow and always prefer to pay in cash.7 p.m. — i get home from publix and get all the groceries unpacked. it was $151.31 which is right on budget. our monthly grocery allowance is $700-$800. i put away the laundry j. started earlier, sweep the floors, and decide to give j. his anniversary gift early because he has this weekend off. he won't get another opportunity like this to have the whole weekend to mess with the skate box and selfishly i'm too excited to see him open it. i grab the box out of his truck and set it in the living room. $151.318 p.m. — j. gets home from orlando and loves the gift. he looks like a little kid, he's so stoked. i'm so glad i reached out to his best friend and got his advice on a high-quality box. j. thanks me profusely and then bikes up to the local park to meet a couple of classmates for a beer. he promises he'll be home by 10 so we can snuggle a bit before bed. i

fill up our thermoses and decide to head home since we spent quite a while on the walking trail.1:30 p.m. — we get home and hop in the shower. we're both starving so i throw some frozen green beans in

did you participate in any form of higher education? if yes, how did you pay for it?yes. my parents are both first to attend college in their families, back home in east asia. they work tirelessly to support me financially and i'll forever be grateful (and paying them back) for that. they expected me to go to college, and ideally grad school. i got about 70% financial aid for both my bachelor's and master's, 20% from my father, and 10% from working part-time throughout college and grad school.growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? did your parent/guardian(s) educate you about finances?we didn't have any conversations, but my father worked 12 hours a day most of my childhood. he was ""absent"" in that sense, but it was clear that his idea of ""a good father"" is to be as financially supportive as possible, which he was. now that he is close to retirement, he still insists on helping me with a down payment (hence the $20,000) and that this is ""the last help"" i'm ever going to get. he always has a cute semi-threat that i'm responsible for their retirement life, and i know that i am expected to support them as is our culture. i'm excited, nervous, and proud to return back what they have so graciously provided for me.what was your first job and why did you get it?so, i am not a u.s. citizen, but i've been here for eight years including college and grad school. for the most part, the only jobs i was allowed to get were on-campus jobs. i worked on campus in college at a campus bookstore, the gym, as a building manager, and as security. i also worked at a domestic violence shelter, a nonprofit mental health org for case management, and a family court for dv victims after college through a work visa.did you worry about money growing up?no. not at all. and working with patients, clients, and my friends who are from less privileged backgrounds, i'm aware of how privileged i am. it took me a long time to be okay with that privilege and i tried my best to work as much to not feel that guilt, but now, i take it, understand the mechanism of capitalism, try to donate as much as possible, and give back to dismantle it as best as i can.do you worry about money now?yes, i worry that my studio is hella expensive. i had to move in under a week because as soon as i graduated, i got a job in the healthcare system where covid was rampant and they expected me to start asap. so, the most convenient thing for a young asian woman was a gentrified apartment with doorman in a gentrified neighborhood, so i got this apartment which is half my paycheck. now that i'm more familiar with the area, i cannot wait to move to a cheaper place so i can give back to my parents more.at what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?i became financially responsible for myself just last year. i was financially dependent on my father for tuition. i still know deep down that i have the luxury of not living paycheck to paycheck and if something were to happen, i can always fly back home and will have my parents' support.do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income?

for you to attend higher education? did you participate in any form of higher education? if yes, how did you pay for it?yep. my mom was an obgyn and my dad was an engineer. both pushed for higher education so i have an undergraduate and master's degree and my sister is a doctor. i went to the u.k. for my university education and my parents paid for it. they also paid for my living expenses for the first month of the first year but promptly cut me off when i blew through the whole term's worth of allowance in a month. i got a job working as a waitress at a sushi restaurant and paid for myself for the rest of the first year. they reinstated my rent money in the second and third year and the first year of my masters (second year of my masters i moved back to hong kong to live with my parents where i worked and studied).growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? did your parent/guardian(s) educate you about finances?not many conversations as my parents were working their butts off to make ends meet when i was a baby. but then my dad's career took off and we became very comfortable. my parents are both retired now and they are enjoying a good life, deservedly so.what was your first job and why did you get it?waitress at a sushi restaurant in the first year of university because my parents cut me off for spending money like a lunatic.did you worry about money growing up?my parents left china when i was 3. my mom gave up everything to support my dad going to school in australia — her medical license, her salary, her independence — and ended up doing things like cutting loose threads in garments to make ends meet. money was tight for a couple of years, but after my dad graduated, he made a good living to the point where he bought land and built our family home in melbourne. then we moved to hong kong and my dad's career really took off, at which point we did not worry about money.do you worry about money now?yes and no. yes, because my husband, v., and i have set out plans for the next few years and we have milestones that we need to hit. no because we make good money, will always have good job opportunities (the importance of building a strong network and never burning bridges is key to having a wealth of good job opportunities to explore!!), and we sit on a healthy safety net so if anything were to go wrong *knock on wood* then we'd be okay in terms of finances and housing.at what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?22, when i moved out of my family home, and into a flat with v. we have built a strong enough financial safety net, but if it were all to go tits up, we could turn to our parents for help.do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? if yes, please explain.v. received an inheritance when his uncle and his grandma passed away. when the time comes, i will as well. in the meantime, as part of my culture, i pay a monthly stipend of $500 to my parents and have done so since i returned to hong kong when i was 21 (so 12 years). they don't ask for the money and i don't know what they do with the money, but i do it because i like to take care of them as they've done such a good job of taking care of me.day one4:30 a.m. — our daughter, b., wakes up shouting, which kind of makes sense as she's hitting herself in the face. she's 10 weeks old and strong as hell, so we have unswaddled her this week and she's been a superstar at sleeping unswaddled. breastfeed her and she passes out again in 15 minutes. stick her back in her next2me and i head back to bed.6:50 a.m. — wake up to my husband, v., passing me a hot water bottle. before most feeds, i put a hot water bottle on my left breast, as i recently had a breast abscess. what does that mean? it means i was in a lot of pain, with multiple visits to a breast surgeon, multiple needles to aspirate the pus that had collected, and multiple visits from a lactation consultant to ""massage"" (aka pummel the sh*t) out of my breast to get the milk flowing.7:25 a.m. — h. arrives. she is our full-time helper and we adore her. she comes into the nursery to say hi and then takes our puppy for his morning walk; he loves rushing into the nursery to say hi and then sprinting off.9 a.m. — b. has been fed, changed, and after playing for an hour on her lovevery play gym, she's back in her nursery to sleep for two hours. we're following a sleep schedule and she's been an absolute champion at learning how to self-settle. we have been very lucky with how good she is at sleeping, but we have also been militant at following the schedule because we love. our. sleep.9:30 a.m. — greek yogurt and homemade granola for breakfast along with my daily supplements. i also do my pt.12 p.m. — feed and change b. then hand her over to h. i grab a quick lunch of potato salad and set off on a lunchtime hike. i like to listen to podcasts while i do this. right now, i'm going through the back catalog of armchair expert (i know!! i'm so late to the game) — it's a good break for me mentally and it's a great challenge physically. 3 p.m. — back! boobs out and b. is feeding away. she loves to look at me, smile, and babble away as she eats.4:30 p.m. — v. has been working from home, and he's finished his last call for the day. he pops on the ergobaby and takes b. out for her early evening walk/nap. i start dinner — we will be having chicken thigh and kimchi stew with pearl barley. it's the easiest meal in the world and absolutely delicious!! 5:30 p.m. — v. and b. are back from their walk. they come into the bedroom to say hello as i'm finishing up some job applications. i take a shower before getting dinner ready for b.7 p.m. — bedtime for b. v. and i make ourselves some fresh lime sodas and hang out. 7:30 p.m. — serve up dinner and start watching unforgotten on itv. it's a british police show and it is absolutely amazing. 10 p.m. — bedtime for me! v. does a last feed and then joins me.daily total: $0day two2 a.m. — b. wakes up shouting. she's done a massive poop and is not happy about it. change her and feed her for 15 minutes and then she's back to bed.6:50 a.m. — alarm goes off! b. is awake and staring at the ceiling. i put her in bed with v. and they start babbling to each other. i do my quick morning routine (brush teeth, contacts in, eat a banana) and head into the nursery to set up for b.'s breakfast.8:50 a.m. — today is bonus day. as i'm on maternity leave, my line manager whatsapp calls me to catch up and let me know what my bonus is. performance this last year has not been great (duh, covid), so going into this conversation, i had the lowest of expectations for the bonus. it turns out to be great so i'm very happy. on the flip side, fixed pay has not increased at all this year — it's company-wide so not a slight on me, but it's still disappointing. h. makes me two hard-boiled eggs for breakfast.10 a.m. — continue working on job applications. i am happy where i am and enjoy the work and the people, but every few years i feel an itch for a change/challenge and i want to up my pay package. i submit three job applications, make a note of them so i don't forget, and save some more jobs to apply to later.11 a.m. — b. scratched her cheeks while sleeping, so i go on amazon to peruse some gloves. i also grab some epsom salts, three books, a big photo frame, and cheap running headphones for v. $671230 — eat leftover kimchi barley stew with ikea's vegan balls to flesh it out a bit. the vegan balls are okay…nothing to write home about. i don't feel like walking today, so i stay on the couch and continue reading the dutch house. i've started and stopped this book so many times and i've finally gotten to near the end today. it's not great tbh. i recently finished a memoir by henry marsh called do no harm and that was a brilliant book. highly recommend.3 p.m. — feed b. who poops twice while feeding. h. takes her and puppy for their afternoon walk. defrost two salmon filets for dinner. i have store credit for a pet food store so i get 36 cans of chicken breast for our cat. i pay the difference. $74:30 p.m. — check our bank accounts, monthly budget, insurance tracker. t loves to track everything we spend and it's rubbed off on me so i do a weekly check-in just to see where we are. monthly budget for february is looking good so far. january was not a great month because it was six weekends and i had the breast abscess. insurance payments are looking good as the breast abscess costs have all come back; thank goodness for that. not only was it so much pain both emotionally and physically, but it cost an absolute sh*t ton. thankfully, we purchased private health insurance for the pregnancy and birth of b. which is still covering me for the rest of this year. coupled with the great work coverage that i have, everything has been covered.7 p.m. — fed and put to bed! b. shouts a bit, but it's friday which means a.) it's the weekend (kind of a bizarre concept during maternity leave) and more importantly b.) we can have an alcoholic beverage! open a bottle of rosé and catch up with v. on his day, who works 50/50 wfh and in the office.8 p.m. — dinner is roasted pesto salmon with quinoa and avocado. dessert is custard-filled tang yuan, a traditional chinese dessert eaten at the end of the lunar new year celebrations.9:30 p.m. — milk and dump it in the sink because of the wine. bedtime!daily total: $74day three2 a.m. — b. is shouting so i pop her on my boob for 20 minutes until she passes out.6:50 a.m. — wake up!8 a.m. — v. plays with b. on the mat. this includes reading a book — today's pick is hairy mclairy from donaldson's dairy.9 a.m. — h. puts b. to sleep in the nursery. i make breakfast for v. and me — avocado on bagels, seasoned with lemon and salt. delicious.10 a.m. — v. takes a shower and then climbs into bed with me. we have sex. it's taken us a while to get to this point because another side effect of breast feeding is a dry vagina. that, coupled with postpartum depression has made sex complicated for me, but incredibly intimate for v. and me. i love my husband very much and he has been such a body of support for me. 12 p.m. — get dressed, feed b., and hand her over to h. as v. and i have a lunch date with my friend and his boyfriend. they've been together for years but for whatever reason, this is the first time v. and i are meeting them as a couple! 2:30 p.m. —we meet for lunch. peking duck is delicious. $1283 p.m. — stop by the thai grocery shop and pick up thai basil and som tam (green papaya salad) for dinner. $64 p.m. — back home, feed b., and now she's lying on the couch babbling away at me. i put on the baby carrier and we head for a walk. after an hour, it's time to head home for her bath!5:30 p.m. — i take a shower. kerastase shampoo and conditioner (the pink ones), aveeno skin relief body wash, dr. g brightening peeling gel (weekly), and cetaphil face wash. skincare is my absolute obsession and right now i'm working through some lighter skincare as i feel like the baby hormones are tipping my skin towards the oily side. toner is a'pieu madecassoside fluid, serum is cosrx snail mucin, moisturizer is tony moly the chok chok green tea watery lotion, and eye cream is cosrx advanced snail peptide eye cream. lip balm is always glossier. body skincare is aromatherapy associates reflect oil (black pepper and jasmine) on my stomach and both sides of my bottom for stretch mark prevention, and the rest of my body i cover in qv lotion. 7 p.m. — onthelist is having a sale on mustela baby products, so i pick up some face creams, body lotions, sunscreens, body washes, and more creams for b. work sent me a huge basket of their things when b. was born in december, and they seem to be super gentle and nice on her so this is a great chance to stock up. $657:30 p.m. — dinner is pad krapow (thai basil and minced pork) served over jasmine rice, and som tam. v. makes me a gin and tonic. i bought some brightly colored gins a while ago in anticipation of my post-pregnancy treats and it was the best decision ever. 9:30 p.m. — milk and dump and then head to bed. daily total: $199day four4 a.m. — feed b. for 15 minutes and then go back to sleep.6:50 a.m. — sunday! wake up and get b. changed and on the boob for breakfast.9 a.m. — instead of playtime today, we put her in the stroller and take her for a two-hour walk. we talk about putting a will in place; we need a will in the u.k. and in hong kong. i add it to my list of things to do next week. stop by the deli to get cheese — 24-month parmesan and pecorino romano. $2112 p.m. — b. has been fed and is now on the playmat with v. i make lunch — roasted peppers and caramelized onions with red pesto pasta. delicious! i also make lunch for tomorrow.2 p.m. — i check my retirement funds — i have two. the mpf fund is doing poorly as the indexes i am tracking are tanking. i make a note to keep an eye on this. my plan is for this to go back up to a certain amount, then i'll switch it to a low-risk index.4:30 p.m. — bundle b. up in the baby carrier and the three of us head out for a walk.5:20 p.m. — b. is growing out of her bodysuits, so i go on next direct and buy her five long sleeve bodysuits, five short sleeve bodysuits, and five pairs of leggings. then i give her dinner and put her to bed. $457:30 p.m. — dinner is a roast. v. roasts a rack of pork and prepares sides including apple cider purple cabbage, honey roasted carrots, and broccoli. he also makes a delicious gravy from scratch to go with the meal.9 p.m. — wash, dry, and wipe up the kitchen while v. takes the pup for a walk. lots of leftovers so we can have a couple of

money and treat myself to a new pair of shoes. $1,0967 p.m. — b. is down for the night so i make dinner and watch tv. my favorite show in the world is back on tv — gogglebox! it's a show where you watch families in the u.k. watch tv. sounds dumb and meta, but it's the loveliest show in the whole wide world and it makes me miss the u.k. and v.'s family very much. we make cups of yorkshire tea, the perfect accompaniment to the show.9:30 p.m. — express milk and head to bed.daily total: $1,168day six6:50 a.m. — b. slept through the night. she does this every now and then, so it's a wonderful

24,"today: an unemployed person who spends some of her money this week on a leather-bound journal.trigger warning: this money diary mentions an eating disorder.occupation: unemployed (laid off due to covid)industry: formerly hospitality age: 34location: charleston, scsalary: $0 (unemployment hasn't come in yet)net worth: approximately $900,000. this includes real estate holdings, savings, and investments. i have no debt. debt: $0 (i pay my credit card bill monthly)paycheck amount: n/apronouns: she/hermonthly expensesrent: $2,865 (for a two-bedroom, three-bath with two parking spaces)internet/cable: $68.10water: $52.21 (this is the minimum amount that i never actually meet so it is exactly the same every month)power: ~$32 (i only turn my heat/ac on in extreme circumstances of when guests come over so it is typically about the same every month)gym: $119cell phone: $82.00savings: $500-$1,000was there an expectation for you to attend higher education? did you participate in any form of higher education? if yes, how did you pay for it?absolutely. it was never a question if i would go to college, it was just a question of where i would go. my parents started a college fund for me when i was born so that i would not have to worry about loans/work while in school. since i ended up going to an in-state school (although out of state for me), the price was significantly less than what they saved for. i was told i could use the leftover money to go towards graduate school, but i ended up going straight into the workforce. i was very lucky to graduate with no loans, and i am so proud of my friends who worked so hard to pay off their loans after graduation!growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? did your parent/guardian(s) educate you about finances?i was taught at a young age that money does not grow on trees and every dollar is hard-earned. just because i wanted something did not mean i should just buy it. in third grade, we learned to balance a checkbook for a math project and i have been doing so ever since. i also learned a lot about savings. every dollar earned (even those $5 in birthday cards) went right into the bank. when i was younger, i hated it, but when i was older and able to buy my first condo at 22, i truly appreciated every penny i was taught to save.what was your first job and why did you get it?my first job was teaching swim lessons/lifeguarding when i was 15. i worked at the same day camp i went to as a kid and loved every minute of it. the camp would let me give private swim lessons to campers after hours in the pool and wouldn't charge me a fee, which was so kind. this money i got to use as spending money, but my paychecks from the camp went right into savings.did you worry about money growing up?yes. there was zero need for me to worry, however, so it was all self-inflicted. i would panic that one day we would wake up and have nothing left. if we went on vacation or even out to dinner, i would cry hysterically that we didn't have the money to do so (we did, my parents were anything but frivolous). lots of therapy has helped me realize this fear stems a lot from my eating disorder and needing a sense of control. i can't control what happens tomorrow, so i fear that i need to hang on to every penny just in case of the unknown. i am still working on this.do you worry about money now?absolutely. when i moved to charleston from washington, d.c., i gave up a very lucrative career to be closer to family. the trade-off was now living in a city where wages are about 1/3 of what they are in d.c. and a new industry that pays less in general. it doesn't help that i am now unemployed and have zero income. while i have good savings and am not in any financial trouble now, it still worries me as i do not know how long this unemployment will last. it keeps me up at night thinking about a stupid purchase i made ten years ago and thinking how i could have that money in the bank now. i am trying to keep calm and not talk myself off a ledge every day since i don't think all the money in the world could keep me from not worrying about it.at what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?i got my first credit card sophomore year of college and have been paying for that on my own expenses ever since. my parents paid for my tuition and rent in college, but i was responsible for all other bills. after i graduated, i was kicked off the family cell phone plan and 100% on my own. if i was ever in trouble, however, my parents would be my safety net. it would have to be a dire need, though, as my pride would have me spend my entire savings before ever asking for help.do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? if yes, please explain.when i was 12 and had my bat mizvah, i was gifted a lot of money from family and friends. all of it went into the bank. this was the nest egg that really started my savings/investments and the ability to buy a condo at 22 in cash. other than that, i have not had any inheritance.day one2 a.m. — i am not what they call a happy camper. my upstairs neighbors decided to have a party last night starting at 12:30 a.m. while i love my place, the walls are thin. on a normal day, i can hear my neighbors if they're just talking. now throw in music, a bass, heels, and what i counted as 22 people finally leaving, and my whole apartment was shaking. i tried texting them to lower the music to no avail and finally around 2 a.m. their guests left. now, however, i am up and pissed and just in an overall bad mood.7:30 a.m. — i think i finally did fall asleep around 4 and am thankful for the little sleep i did get last night. hop out of bed and get ready for the gym. before the covid police come at me, i am going to say this: don't. gyms are allowed to be open here. my gym closes every day for two hours to be professionally cleaned. classes are only five people. all precautions have been taken and there has not been one outbreak that has come from where i go. my gym is my mental health outlet. the people there have become some of my closest friends and have gotten me through some dark times. i clean up a little while i waste time before getting dressed and i am out the door!10 a.m. — that was a doozy of a class, but i feel so good afterward! jump in the shower the minute i get home to wash off. about a month ago i hung some eucalyptus in my shower, and it is a game-changer! not only does it smell amazing, but it's also supposed to be good for your sinuses. highly recommend! get out of the shower and do my face routine. i am proud to say i am now five weeks in to being an adult with a skin routine! i use environ skin essentia mild cleansing lotion and biologique recherche lotion p50 toner.11 a.m. — this is way past my coffee time, i do not know how the day is going by so quickly! turn on my nespresso and brew a cup to enjoy back in my bed. i love coffee (i have three different coffee makers at home) and my nespresso machine is my favorite. best $99 i have ever spent. pro-tip, wait until thanksgiving/christmas time and nespresso always lowers their machine prices to $99. you will thank me later!1 p.m. — i spent the morning working on a letter for a contact that reached out to help me with my job search and then take a break. put on some black leggings, a green banana republic sweater, and some simple jewelry and decide i am going to go over to my parents' house. i do not want another episode tonight like last night and am going to just remove myself from the situation. i will talk to my property manager about it on monday. tomorrow is also valentine's day and i am feeling a little down about being alone (again). i pack an overnight bag and head out.2 p.m. — time for lunch. my dad makes the best grilled cheese sandwiches so i ask him to make one for me. i sit and eat with my parents and we catch up. my dad got his second vaccination today and we are all happy and grateful he doesn't seem to be having any adverse reactions yet. we also talk about my sister, n. a year and a half ago, one month after her 30th birthday she was diagnosed with breast cancer. after a double mastectomy, 63 weeks of intravenous chemo, she just started oral chemo that she will be on for a year. it has had some nasty side effects, but hopefully, they have figured out a good plan of action. even before covid, our world had already been turned upside down. as a family, we just take everything day by day now.5 p.m. — it has been a slow and rainy day. i mostly work on my resume. i keep hoping the rain will stop so i can go out for a run, but it just keeps coming down. decide to shut down my computer and go downstairs to sit with my parents. we watch a few episodes of house hunters before my mom and i start dinner.7 p.m. — my mom and i make fettuccine pasta with grilled chicken and grilled steak with a mushroom sauce for dinner. the three of us eat, talk, and just hang out for the rest of the night.10:30 p.m. — i call it a night and go up to my bedroom. face routine and pjs before crawling under the weighted blanket i keep in my room here. it is so cozy. i like to fall asleep to some sort of noise, and my favorite noise is old episodes of the golden girls. this show is so funny. my head hits the pillow and it is not long before i pass out.daily total: $0day two7:30 a.m. — happy valentine's day! i check my phone and think it is odd my dad has still not texted me. whenever i sleep over, my dad texts me when he puts the coffee up. we are both super early morning people, and by 7:30, it is unusual not to hear from him. i start to panic a little that he has had a reaction to the vaccine and something is wrong so i sprint downstairs to my parent's bedroom, and see he is just still asleep. i guess everyone needs a day to just sleep in. go back up to my room and scroll social media but get too depressed with all the v-day stuff. i start to feel sad that i am still single at 34 with no prospects and think about what my life ""should have been."" decide to distract my mind with more resume work.10 a.m. — everyone is up, and n. stops by to say happy valentine's day. dad surprises us all with coffee and waffles. it is really nice to have the four of us sitting all together for a happy occasion. n. heads out to her boyfriend's and my dad asks if i want to go on an errand run with him. i have nothing else going on so i get dressed and dig out a pair of rain boots from the closet. mask up and we are out the door by noon.2:30 p.m. — our trip was a bust. i think we got four things from my dad's list. most importantly, we did get flowers for my mom from him, so that was a plus. when we lived in new york and he commuted to nyc every day, he would bring my mom flowers from his ""flower guy."" he has yet to find a replacement here, so trader joe's does the trick. i end up not getting anything while we are out. back home and we try to figure out what to do for lunch. we want tacos but with the bad weather, we decide to just make something. going full-on nostalgia today and i ask my mom for a good ole fashion tuna melt. happy camper here.4 p.m. — the weather is beyond bad here! it is just one extended downpour. two weeks ago, i hydroplaned on the highway (literally did a 360 spin across four lanes of traffic, it is a miracle i'm okay). i am still very uneasy driving, and in this weather, it gives me a little panic attack just considering it. i cancel the gym for tomorrow morning and decide to stay another night here. it is not really what i want to do, but honestly, i am too scared to drive home. my mom and i curl up on the couch and watch the last few episodes of the revived mad about you. in terms of reboots, i would recommend it if you enjoyed it when it first aired in the '90s.7 p.m. — another dinner with my parents. my mom makes my dad a pot roast, but i just have some leftovers and a bud light since i am not that hungry. after dinner, we indulge in our favorite guilty pleasure, 90 day fiancé. this show just makes us laugh so much. i check the weather outlook for tomorrow since i am supposed to play tennis at 9 a.m. with my friend, t., but i am not sure if the courts will be dry.10 p.m. — still no word about if tennis is on for tomorrow morning, so i set my alarm as if it is. i will need to leave my parents, go back to my apartment to change and get my racket, then go to the courts, all during rush hour, so i want to plan accordingly. i wash my face and get ready for bed. golden girls on the tv and i fall asleep around 11:30.daily total: $0day three2:30 a.m. — a sneezing fit wakes me up. gotta love allergies! it is way too early for this. take a zyrtec and wait for it to kick in.6 a.m. — alarm goes off and still no word from tennis so i guess it is on. get dressed, make my bed, take the trash from my bedroom and bathroom downstairs, and pack up the rest of my stuff to go. just as i am about to put on my rain boots, t. calls and says everything is still wet outside, the courts aren't safe to play on. welp! since i am up, i sneak into my parent's room and lure the dog out for a walk. t. was right, it is still wet and misting out.7 a.m. — it is my favorite time of the day, just my dad and me having coffee together. the routine is the same every time, but it is something that i really cherish. he asks if i want anything for breakfast, but coffee is all i am wanting this morning. by the time he is done eating, my mom is up and we are all in the kitchen talking.10 a.m. — n. comes by before her gym class and tells us about her valentine's day night. she didn't realize she would need reservations, and of course, she didn't have one. she and her boyfriend ended up going around to the local fast food joints and ranking all of the chicken nuggets. honestly, it sounds amazing! the winner was zaxby's, followed closely by popeye's. it was sunday, so chick-fil-a was obviously closed, but we all agree they are just in a category by themselves. n., my mom, and i hang out and look at engagement rings and chat, while my dad goes into his office. we also turn on rhoa to play in the background for more entertainment.11:15 a.m. — it is time for me to finally go home. the rain has stopped and i want to beat any lunchtime traffic on the roads. i repack my stuff, say goodbye to everyone, and hit the road. about three miles from home, i get super emotional and just start to cry. i am not really sure where it comes from, but sometimes you just need a good cry. i am done by the time i get home. unpack my car and start up my washing machine to do sunday laundry today. i heat up some water and toss in a lemon slice and start googling jobs on the internet.1 p.m. — lunchtime! i am running low at home so i really need to make plans to go grocery shopping. in the meantime, i steam some broccoli while i munch on blueberries. i make some cauliflower and teriyaki sauce and mix that with spinach. i throw in some chicken sausage and lunch is served!5 p.m. — the day just kind of floats by. so goes the life of unemployment in a time of covid right? i should eat a real dinner but i am not really hungry and while normally, i love to cook, i am just not feeling it today. i put some peanut butter on a rice cake and call it a day. i contemplate finding a book to read but i am burnt out from reading. during shelter in place, i read 53 books. basically from the time i woke up to the time i went to sleep, i read. i love reading, but as much as i want to, it just is not appealing to me right now. i turn on hbo max and browse what is new. currently, i am mooching netflix/hulu/hbo max from my parents and sister. when i get a job, i will take over paying for one of them. decide on there is no i in threesome and have low expectations.9 p.m. — well. that was much better than i had expected! it wasn't so much that i didn't see the ending coming, but i was very surprised by the way it was done! i would recommend watching! it is an acceptable time to finally put my pjs on so i do my face routine and crawl into bed. i put on re-runs of law and order and scroll instagram for an obscene amount of time. eventually, i switch over to the golden girls and turn off my phone. i think the last time i see the time is around 11.daily total: $0day four5 a.m. — up and at 'em! gym time. roll out of bed and get dressed in the gym clothes i took out the night before. check my email and drive to the gym. another benefit of going to the gym at this time is there is a high chance i will not hit one red light on my drive. if i hit all the lights at the right time, i can make it to the gym in about four minutes!7:15 a.m. — great workout. i'm going back this afternoon for a double and i highly consider just not changing, but while i can be very lazy, i am not dirty. shower, face routine, and put a fresh clean pair of gym clothes on. fire up the nespresso maker and take my coffee back to my bed to just snuggle a little while longer.9 a.m. — i am a person who thrives on consistency and routine, so when i lost my job, i gave myself three days of wallowing and staying in bed, and then i set a routine. while i am not necessarily working, i make sure that by 9 a.m. i am dressed and at my ""desk"" (aka my kitchen counter that used to be my desk when i was wfh). i check my email and do some light job searching. i am getting to the point where i am finding the same jobs that i have either been rejected from or have already applied to over and over and it is defeating.10:30 a.m. — take a break from ""work"" and do some gift shopping online. my friend t.'s birthday is quickly approaching and i still need to get her a gift. i pride myself on my gift-giving abilities. keep a few tabs open of ideas and decide to not make a decision right now.11 a.m. — the sun is finally out! it is so nice out, i decide to go on a walk outside for some fresh air. at the height of lockdown, i was walking up to 12 miles a day. i never listened to podcasts before but got very into them during my walks. pop in my headphones and put on two judgey girls. if you love reality tv like me, please listen to this podcast. these girls are really funny. i also recommend reality life with kate casey. both these podcasts will have you in stitches. before i head out, i take out some chicken breasts from the refrigerator and toss them in salt, butter, garlic, honey, lemon, soy sauce, fish sauce, and a little hot sauce, to marinate. i have no idea how they will taste, but isn't that how all the best recipes come to be? hat on and i am off!1 p.m. — it is beautiful outside! still a little chilly for me, but i am a freak who enjoys 85-degree weather. i contemplate going over to n.'s apartment to help her pack (she is moving), but she tells me not to since my parents and her boyfriend are there and it will just be one more personality to deal with. i am not too disappointed, i am just bored. i get into a cleaning kick, and next thing i know, i am knee-deep cleaning my oven and stove. i used to have a cleaning lady come once every six months to do a deep clean on my place, but with covid and now unemployment, that is not in the cards. i do not do as good of a job as her but it is passable.2 p.m. — i called up t.'s husband to confirm that what i was thinking for the birthday gift would be a good choice. he gives me his seal of approval and i make the purchase. i buy her an embossed leather-bound journal. it should be here in about a week which is perfect timing for her birthday! shipping is free, which i love and the embossing is just a small fee. $1053 p.m. — i have to leave for the gym in a little over an hour, so i decide to put the chicken breasts i have been marinating in the oven to cook now. i am not sure if i will eat them when i get home, but i would rather them be ready to eat than have to cook them later.5:30 p.m. — back from the gym. cook some brown rice as i shower. i sauté some spinach and chickpeas. toss everything together with a little soy sauce and top it off with the chicken i made. i am meeting n. for trivia at an outdoor brewery. tables are limited to six people and they are maxing out at six tables. i put on some jeans from banana republic and a blouse from halogen. i think this is the first time in weeks i have semi put makeup on. just some simple bobbi brown eyeshadow, eyebrow pencil, chanel eyeliner, and revlon mascara. finish off the outfit with black frye boots. 7 p.m. — i am beyond impressed with how the brewery has set up trivia. it is so spaced out that even talking at an above-normal tone, the other tables couldn't hear you. it has been such a tough year for so many of these establishments, it feels good to be out and safely supporting them! our team is me, n., her boyfriend, and two of their friends. the brewery is running bucket of beers and hard seltzer specials and n. gets a bucket of both. i have two beers and n. treats. trivia is hard! we are a competitive group though and we end up coming in third! a little disappointing since we were in first at one point but we walk away with a $100 gift card! after trivia, n. and her group stay, but i say goodnight because i am old and need to go to bed. 10 p.m. — face routine, pjs, and crawl into bed. i get sucked into a lifetime movie on hulu, abducted: the mary stauffer story. wow. i get sucked into googling the real mary stauffer and her ordeal. finally call it quits around 11. golden girls and it is lights out for me. daily total: $105day five5 a.m. — my alarm actually wakes me up, instead of me waking up before it goes off. shockingly though, i am not that tired. roll out of bed and it's the same routine as usual. gym clothes, check email, and i am out the door for the gym. even in the dark and cold, this place just makes me feel good. it's the people.7:15 a.m. — another great workout in the books. back home and get the nespresso going. my friend, f., is coming over in a little to go for a walk since it is day two of no rain, so i hold off showering. towards the end of my workout, i started having these sharp pains in my stomach. at the beginning of january, my obgyn found two very large (8+cm) uterine fibroids. due to their size, it would require an invasive surgery to remove them (i would have to be cut hip to hip), so my doctor wants to wait and see what they do on their own. the pain they are causing, however, is becoming worse and more frequent. does anyone have any experience with this? any suggestions are welcome!8:30 a.m. — f. comes over and we bundle up for our walk. we walk over to a local coffee spot. we both get black drip coffee and f. covers mine. my friends and i just always trade-off with one another. everything comes out in the wash, so there is no need to send her the $2. we walk and talk and catch up. it is chilly but walking makes it bearable. f. is one of my closest friends, and with covid, i haven't seen her as much so i really appreciate these walks we go on.10:30 a.m. — i meet n. at the construction site of the new townhouse she is building. it is predicted to be done in april. i am really excited for her. she asks if i will help her decorate because i have a good eye, and i have never gotten such a nice compliment from her. she heads out to the gym and i go literally around the corner to the hospital for my second covid shot! in january, i found out that you can be on a waiting list so the hospital does not waste any doses. at the end of the day, if there are extra doses, you can get vaccinated. it is such a smart idea because if they are not used, the doses would have to be thrown out. the one benefit of unemployment is i have all the time in the world to wait around and see if there would be extra. sure enough, i was lucky and got my first shot. my whole family will now be vaccinated by next week.11:15 a.m. — that was possibly the quickest experience of my life! they took me early, and even with waiting 15 minutes after, i was out of there in maybe 25 minutes! my mom is a little worried about side effects, so i drive over to their house after my shot so she can ""keep an eye on me."" of course, when i get there my mom wants to feed me, but she has no food. so while she and my dad run to the grocery store, i jump in the shower. the water heater in their house is like magic and i take the hottest shower i can handle. it feels amazing.12 p.m. — lunch with my mom and dad. i have a turkey sandwich with muenster cheese, lettuce, and tomato. after we eat, i snag a few snacks from my parents' pantry and hit the road. on my drive home, i catch up with t. we try to figure out another day to play tennis, but hold off on any plans, because it looks like the rain will be coming back.2:30 p.m. — my arm is starting to hurt. it isn't awful, just like it felt earlier in the year when i got my flu shot. i eat some sliced-up kiwi and a wave of exhaustion comes over me. grab my favorite blanket and curl up on the couch.6 p.m. — so tired today. i have mostly rotated between my couch and my ""desk"" all day. the pain in my arm is getting worse, but if this is the only side effect i feel, that will be a win for me. my evening is uneventful, just texting back and forth with friends, with my mom calling periodically to make sure i am not running a fever or suffering some bad reaction. i assure her i am not unless you consider being cold in an apartment where i have not turned the heat on. she chuckles and says to go stand outside in my underwear to see if i warm up.9 p.m. — by this point, my arm is so sore any movement causes some immense pain. i try to lay in bed but cannot get comfortable. i crack and take two tylenol, hoping they will relieve the pain enough for me to sleep. i toss and turn but finally, fall asleep around 10:45.daily total: $0day six3:45 a.m. — nope. too early even for me!5 a.m. — much better. my arm is still sore, but i decide it is not sore enough to skip the gym. get dressed and check my email. i also check the weather and looks like rain again today. womp. my head feels a little stuffy, kind of like when my allergies get bad. i check my temperature just in case since i do not want to drive to the gym only for them to turn me away for having one. nope. totally normal. in the car and on my way i go.7 a.m. — great workout. i am glad i went. even without going at 100%, it felt good to move and sweat. home and in the shower soaking in all the eucalyptus smells. i am still really tired when i get out, so i decide to set my alarm for an hour and take a nap. take two more tylenol as well, since they seemed to work last night.8:30 a.m. — hit snooze once... or twice... but when i get up, i feel good. must have been what my body needed. i put on some br jeans, a shoshanna sweater, a lululemon scarf, and a gap puffy vest, and get my coffee going. yes, i am dressed like it is 20 degrees, even though it's definitely 50. i am going to look at a few condos today. i hate renting, i feel like it is just throwing money away. plus the issue with the thin walls and my upstairs neighbors. i am anxious to get out but want it to be a smart choice. make a second cup of coffee and check my email before putting on rain boots and heading out to meet my real estate agents.11:30 a.m. — made it back just in time for the rain to start again. out of the four houses/condos i looked at, two are definitely contenders. it stresses me out thinking about buying, but i know it is better than renting. n. calls when i get back and asks if i will meet her this afternoon at her townhouse. i have nothing else going on so i tell her sure!1 p.m. — on my way home from meeting n., i pass by aldi and make a quick stop because they have the best prices for everything you need to stock your pantry. i buy two cases of seltzer, two pints of cherry tomatoes, ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, spicy hummus, spicy chunky salsa, cake mix, brownie mix, sweet peppers, mini potatoes, and dark chocolate with sea salt bites ($35.73). thankfully i keep grocery bags in the car for last-minute stops like this! $35.731:30 p.m. — yikes! my gas tank is really low. ugh, when did gas get expensive again? fill up my tank ($43.51) and head on home. $43.512:30 p.m. — if you haven't guessed, i have been totally influenced by the feta and tomato baked pasta all over instagram as of late. i use ricotta cheese instead of feta, since i am not a huge feta fan, boil some pasta, and put the cheese and tomatoes in the oven. when everything is done, i mix in some shrimp salad my mom made, spinach, and red pepper flakes. omg, it is so good. you win this time, internet!5 p.m. — i text with t. about the homes i saw today and weigh out my options with her as a sounding board. a lot of my friends have been texting me to see how i am feeling after my second shot and thankfully — knock on wood — i am feeling pretty good. besides the sore arm, my sinuses are a little stuffy, but that could be just unrelated.5:30 p.m. — i completely forgot i told my friend, k., that i would go tour our new gym space with her today. our gym is closing next week and is opening up in a different space. i have already had a tour by the owner, but k. has not seen it yet, so we set it up with him to go see it this evening. rain boots, mask, and i go meet up with them. the space is just amazing. as soon as i get back home about an hour later, the skies open up and the rain just starts coming down in buckets. i am not even going to kid myself, it is already dark out so pjs are completely acceptable!10 p.m. — knock back two more tylenol before i crawl into bed since my arm is still painful. i am taking a rest day tomorrow from the gym so i am looking forward to sleeping in (hopefully). catch up on the premiere of rhonj (team jackie) and then switch over to the golden girls. face routine and i'm out by 12:30.daily total: $79.24day seven3:20 a.m. — so much for sleeping in today! i have no idea why i am wide awake. oddly enough, n. is up as well and sends me a random text thinking i would see it in the acceptable morning hours. i text back that i am up and we chat for a little bit. i just stare at the ceiling and hope to fall asleep again.6:00 a.m. — i am officially awake and up. make some coffee and decide it is time to change my sheets. i absolutely hate changing my sheets but love having fresh clean sheets on my bed. check my email and am extremely frustrated to see the unemployment office has had time to revamp their website but not enough time to validate my claim. it has been almost a month now, and while every time i call i speak to very nice people, no one has been helpful. i have been on hold for four hours for three minutes of talking to someone who told me they couldn't help me with knowing when my benefits will be approved. i understand they are overwhelmed, but that does not help my situation. ugh.10 a.m. — an alarm goes off on my phone to pay my rent (noted in the above monthly expenses). i like to pay early so that there is never a question if i am late or not. and yes, i set an alarm as a reminder every month. very type a here, i like lists, reminders, calendar invites, color coordinating, the works. pay my rent and send with it a note about how once again this past month i had to sleep elsewhere because of the noise upstairs. this month was not bad, only four nights, but it should be zero.11:30 a.m. — tomorrow is my dad's birthday so i decide to whip up a batch of chocolate chip cookies for the occasion. things i always keep stocked in my pantry and fridge are baking essentials for the go-tos; cookies, cakes, brownies, muffins. that way i can easily whip something up if an occasion arises last minute. i am a pretty good baker and over quarantine, like most people, i baked everything and anything. thankfully i find it therapeutic so i haven't burned out yet! batter in the refrigerator for 15 minutes then nine minutes in the oven and poof! cookies for the birthday boy!1 p.m. — feeling hungry so i heat up some of the pasta from yesterday. while it heats i eat one of the cookies i made this morning. have to make sure they are edible before giving them to the birthday boy, right? surprisingly pleased with how they turned out.3 p.m. — rain is still coming down in buckets. we haven't seen this much rain here in such a long time, and it isn't even hurricane season. the darkness outside and the sound of the rain are making me so sleepy. i lay down in bed and plan to nap for 45 minutes but i end up just scrolling instagram and not sleeping at all.7 p.m. — the music upstairs is already bumping and i am highly debating calling it quits and just going to my parents to sleep. it is not what i want to do, but i also do not want to be constantly asking them to turn down the music, and then texting my property manager with updates on how they haven't turned down the music. i am too old for this. before anyone asks, i moved in here first, right after the place was built. these are not new issues. i have been saying there needs to be better sound insulation since the first tenants moved in. just nothing has been done and i am looked at as the old complaining neighbor. 11 p.m. — it has finally stopped vibrating from the music, so i quickly wash up and jump into bed. my alarm is set for 11:59 p.m. my family has this thing where we try to be the first one to call the birthday person. i typically am the winner, probably because i set an alarm! looking forward to celebrating my dad tomorrow, he deserves it. good night!daily total: $0"

yes, how did you pay for it?yes, i was not given a choice by my parents. my father was a carpenter and coal miner and did not attend school after high school. my mother had dreams of becoming a nurse but after taking one year of courses at our local community college, she felt she was missing too much time with her kids and dropped out. my parents married young and had children young, so they never really had the opportunity to pursue higher education as they were focused on raising our family and supporting us. my mother worked for years as a dental assistant before retiring. i was fortunate in that my parents were financially able to pay for my undergraduate courses and i graduated with a ba in education. i married my husband two years after landing my first teaching job and becoming financially independent, so when i went back to school to pursue my master's degree, my rank i in education, and then my doctorate in education, i paid. my husband and i were able to pay for my master's degree and rank i ourselves, but as i found out quite unexpectedly that i was pregnant shortly after beginning my doctorate (i was told i could not have children so we were quite surprised), we used my education fund as our baby fund and i took out student loans for my doctorate. i will complete that in the next year; i'm halfway through writing my dissertation and should defend it this coming fall semester.growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? did your parent/guardian(s) educate you about finances?i was the youngest of three daughters, and my parents wanted us to have a solid understanding of finances when we became adults so they had very frank conversations with us. my parents opened each of us up a checking account at the age of 16 and helped each of us get our first credit card before we went to college, but it was our responsibility to get a job to put money into our checking accounts and pay our credit card bills. my mother was always very honest with me about their finances when growing up and i often ran errands for her to pay bills once i obtained my driver's license, so i was aware of what their finances looked like and what their bills cost. this may not be normal for some families, but their honesty with finances helped shape a realistic view of what i needed to earn to pay bills as an adult. my husband and i met in college and got engaged within a year of dating, but we were engaged for six years because we broke down what our bills would look like and what we needed to earn to be able to pay them. when we were financially stable enough to pay those bills, we then planned the wedding and got married. my parents played a large part in helping us map out that financial road map.what was your first job and why did you get it?my first job was as a babysitter for my mom's boss. i babysat their kids on weekends, during spring, fall, and summer vacations, and on an as-needed basis for six years. i took the job because i had just turned sixteen and needed to earn money to pay for my gas and car insurance, and their children were young and they wanted someone they knew to watch them. after that, i began working at a local call center while i looked for teaching jobs. this was the first job i had where i was able to earn financial independence from my parents and establish my adult life/finances.did you worry about money growing up?for the most part, i did not worry about money growing up. though my parents were not wealthy, we never came close to living below the poverty line. there were times when money was tight for our family and my parents were honest with us, but it was never a situation where we were ever in danger of losing our home. both my parents worked consistently throughout my life and really only ever experienced job insecurity when the coal mining community in our area began suffering.do you worry about money now?occasionally i do, but that is usually only after something in our house needs replacing and i panic thinking of having to use a credit card. i am not a fan of using credit cards if i can avoid it, and while we are able to pay our balances every month, i get anxiety thinking of having to put a sum on a credit card. we recently replaced our refrigerator in our kitchen, and though we could have done it sooner and put it on our credit card, i refused and we saved up every paycheck until we were able to pay cash for the one we wanted.at what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?i became financially responsible for myself at 22. my parents allowed me to move home and live with them while job hunting, but when i found my first job, it was then my responsibility to pay for my bills, needs, and wants. however, they have always been more than willing to help us out and did have to help us once after we both unexpectedly lost our jobs a couple of years into our marriage. thankfully, we were able to find something quickly, pay them back, and get back on our feet in a couple of months. they are there as our safety net if needed.do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? if yes, please explain.yes. the land my house sits on was given to me as a gift by my parents. they own a large amount of land in a few different areas in our county and

$160was there an expectation for you to attend higher education? did you participate in any form of higher education? if yes, how did you pay for it?going to college was the path of least resistance for me. i was extremely fortunate that my parents paid all my college expenses.growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? did your parent/guardian(s) educate you about finances?my family didn't directly talk about money very often. i got the sense that it was taboo, or at least gauche to talk about. my parents imparted healthy money habits and values through positive role-modeling, such as, pay the higher upfront cost for quality goods, buy secondhand when it makes sense, and take good care of your possessions to save money later on. they also taught me to live below my means and be frugal where i can, but also don't wait for retirement to enjoy my money; and don't buy anything i can't afford to pay cash for (other than a house).what was your first job and why did you get it?teenage babysitting gigs earned me a few bucks, but my first real job was at a craft store when i was 20. i worked part-time while going to school full-time. my starting wage was $6.50/hour and i spent a good chunk of it on yarn and fabric to feed my knitting and sewing addictions.did you worry about money growing up?yes, but in hindsight, i recognize that was silly. we were solidly upper middle class, with my mom pulling a healthy six-figure income and my dad staying home to take care of me. they bought a second home in a nearby resort town, and we took annual vacations to hawaii and to the east coast to visit family. they paid off both their mortgages early and built their wealth with smart investments. growing up, though, there was a lot of mystery and misunderstanding about money on my part. for instance, once when i was little i asked if we could go to a fancy seafood restaurant for dinner, and my mom made some off-handed remark, like, ""we can't afford to eat there every night."" i made a few over-simplified calculations and became convinced that we were on the edge of poverty.do you worry about money now?yes, i worry, probably irrationally. graduating college during the great recession and struggling to find employment right out of the gate instilled in me a scarcity and insecurity mindset that i can't seem to shake. i know that my wife and i are in a privileged and stable situation money-wise, but it feels tenuous, fraught with uncertainty like it could all collapse at any moment.at what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?i started paying for my own phone, clothes, gas, etc. in my late teens, but i relied on my parents for housing, food, and insurance until i landed my first full-time job at age 26. now, my parents would provide a safety net if needed, but my wife and i would have to fall through our own safety nets before hitting theirs.do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? if yes, please explain.i inherited $10,000 from my grandparents' estate when i was in my late teens. my parents gave me an allowance as a kid and bought me my first car (which i still drive nearly 20 years later).day one8:45 a.m. — i wake up longing to sleep later, but our dogs and my bladder are all having none of it. i let the dogs out, bring fresh water to our chickens, and give everyone their morning treats. i cook fried egg poutine with local cheese curds for breakfast (it's superbowl sunday, and i'm here for the snacks).11 a.m. — my wife, y., shuts herself in the office to lead an alcoholics anonymous meeting via zoom. she's been sober for years and i'm incredibly proud of her. while she's busy i enjoy alone time on the couch, cuddling with the pups, drinking coffee, and reading the paper.1 p.m. —y. picks up veggie sub sandwiches for lunch, plus a sadly undrinkable iced coffee that tastes like someone incinerated a pile of espresso beans and soaked them overnight in skim milk. $25.794:30 p.m. — time for sports ball. go sports! we initially root for the team with the non-racist name, but switch allegiances upon finding out their star quarterback is a trump supporter.6 p.m. — ""our"" team is having a rough day. y. tries to tell me what's happening in the game and i invariably react the wrong way, exasperating her.8 p.m. — the game is almost over and we're finally hungry for snacks. i make a mound o' nachos for dinner and we stuff our faces.11 p.m. — glance at my email and check my outlook calendar for monday morning meetings. i work on a global team with coworkers on the other side of the planet, so sometimes meetings start at 7 a.m. (or, god forbid, 6). luckily my calendar is clear until 10. the dogs and i pile into bed with y. who is beset with cramps. i fetch her some ibuprofen and water.daily total: $25.79day two7:45 a.m. — our dueling alarm clocks start going off. we both repeatedly hit snooze for a full hour. i groggily commence my morning phone business: catching up on a group chat, reading the nyt morning briefing email, checking my gambling stocks. i have a small brokerage account separate from my real investments where i swing trade using money i'd be comfortable losing. it scratches the itch for active, risky trading. i'm up 142% on my initial $1,000 after seven months.9 a.m. — finally make it to the (home) office after brewing coffee and tending to the animals. i start reading emails and figuring out priorities for the week. y. leaves for work. she worked from home alongside me through most of the pandemic, but has to go in for the next few weeks. i miss having her with me, but it is nice to get a break from coordinating our meeting schedules and taking turns relocating to a different room when there's a conflict.10 a.m. — realize i haven't eaten breakfast, but i'm still full from nachos the night before, so i munch a mandarin and call it good. join my first meeting of the day. our smallest and neediest dog takes his position on my lap.11 a.m. — the burnout is real. over the last couple of weeks, i've hit a productivity wall. the stress that once powered me through work tasks has transformed into paralyzing guilt and shame and exhaustion. at least i'm not alone — my closest coworker friends are in the same boat. instead of taking any action to remedy the situation, we trade memes about it throughout the day like responsible adults.12 p.m. — i make a sandwich for lunch and scroll through instagram. i check my investment accounts and find that i've hit a milestone: $150,000. my company's stock is at an all-time high, so i sell a long-held chunk of my espp that i scored over 60% gains on, freeing up $5,000 to move to more diversified holdings.1 p.m. — meeting where i'm notified about a confidential, earth-shatteringly huge upcoming project that literally nobody needs on their plate right now. the dogs sense that i'm having an important conversation and serenade me with their barking accordingly. i get a text from my mom saying she got the first vaccine shot. both my parents are super healthy, but they're over 65, so i've been very worried about them catching the virus. my dad is scheduled to get his first shot on thursday.6 p.m. — y. comes home with groceries: avocados, milk, frozen meals (for office lunches), diet soda, and an excessive amount of valentine's candy ($52.84). we sit on the couch to chat about our days. she plays a game on her ps5 while i make dinner — big salads topped with avocado and vegetarian chicken strips. we start watching season three of the sinner on netflix. $52.8410 p.m. — i lock into revenge bedtime procrastination on my phone and snack on a couple of slices of toast and a mandarin before finally joining y. in bed at 11:30.daily total: $52.84day three7:45 a.m. — my 7 a.m. meeting was canceled, but i still have an ugly back-to-back zoom block from 8-11, followed by a rush to publish a bunch of high-priority articles at precisely 11 a.m. one meeting ends 10 minutes early, so i use that pocket of time to make scrambled eggs for breakfast. y. stops by my desk for a smooch and leaves for work.10 a.m. — they've brought in a consultant for a teambuilding exercise, which is basically teaching us how to interact with other humans. webcams are mandatory. every new breakout room is an awkward, forced exchange with strangers, while salty ims are flying behind the scenes. coach repeatedly tells us to smile. i message some friends the iconic photo of abbi and ilana using their middle fingers to prop up the corners of their mouths.11 a.m. — the technology gods smile upon me as i'm able to get all my urgent publications out the door on time with no system issues. i send some emails, closeout some tickets, and then step away to heat up lunch: veggie spring rolls with sweet chili sauce and a coke zero.1 p.m. — another block of meetings, but at least they're productive? it's been a busy day and i'm getting a lot done. later in the afternoon, i have a weekly fun zoom call with coworker friends.6 p.m. — y. comes home and we cuddle up in bed to debrief about our days. 6:30 p.m. — i slice up a couple of homegrown onions to caramelize. last season we urban farmed like our lives depended on it; y. rebuilt all the garden beds in our backyard plus two new raised beds out front, and she rototilled a huge new patch of land to grow corn, melons, pumpkins, beans, and squash. the raised beds were bursting with salad greens, root veggies, and sugar snap peas, and the backyard garden was full of tomatoes, cabbage, peppers, eggplants, herbs, raspberries, and an entire 4x14 bed of sweet onions. our homegrown produce and chicken eggs helped us minimize trips to the grocery store in pandemic times. by now we've used up everything except for a few cubes of frozen basil, a pie pumpkin, and two sacks of cured onions hanging in the basement.7:30 p.m. — dinner is finally ready. i've been trying to replicate a vegetarian philly cheesesteak sandwich that y. fell in love with in san diego. i load up a couple of hoagie rolls with onions, impossible beef, chanterelle mushrooms, and melted american cheese, and it's not quite restaurant quality, but it's tasty. 9 p.m. — i spend a few hours working through a diversity, equity & inclusion prework packet for a training session tomorrow. included are a couple of excellent youtube videos about our system of white supremacist capitalist patriarchy: ""how can we win"" by kimberly l. jones and ""people, systems, and the game of monopoly"" by allan g. johnson. i come away with a deeper understanding and appreciation for some of the more vilified actions of fringe blm activists. daily total: $0day four7 a.m. — wake up, do my hair and makeup, put on a real shirt, plant myself in front of my computer and adapt to the glare of my ring light and the strain of proper posture. i'll be on camera all day, so i need to dampen the scoliotic swamp-witch vibes i exude when i'm comfortably hidden behind a closed webcam cover.7:45 a.m. — join my zoom session. i'm in a two-year leadership program with monthly sessions on local healthcare, education, government, etc., plus volunteer service projects and a monthly featured nonprofit. like my brief stint in grad school, i applied for this program during a fleeting spell of ambition and later regretted it due to my commitment to laziness and free time. the program is actually awesome, it's just a bummer to miss out on the in-person experience. nine solid hours on zoom is draining. today's session topic is business, and the featured nonprofit is a catering company that hires and trains opportunity youths. i chip in $50 and submit a donation match request through work. $5010:30 a.m. — i'm excited for the de&i session, ready to discuss whether it's reasonable to think we can sufficiently change the game while we (a group of mostly white, affluent, fine young capitalists) actively play and benefit from it. conversation in the zoom chat turns to complaints of ""reverse discrimination"" and worries over cancel culture. yep, i'm still in idaho. i suppress my auto-snark and offer gentle dissent instead. the speaker prompts stimulating breakout group conversations about our backgrounds, culture, and the concept of otherness.12 p.m. — i make stir-fried veggies and rice for lunch. y. is working from home and takes a break to eat with me. after lunch, the rest of the zoom lineup includes experts on smart growth, startup incubation, the scarf model, driving effective teams, and preparing for the future of work. we end with a social hour, breaking out into groups to design fake companies and job descriptions around fanciful job titles. my group of overachievers makes a detailed slide deck for our presentation.6 p.m. — i'm wiped out and i have a headache from wearing a headset nonstop. i want to make something more interesting for dinner, but i need fast comfort food, so i make grilled cheese sandwiches and edamame. i had grand plans to catch up on work this evening, but it's not happening. i'm a husk with nothing left to offer the world. netflix instead.daily total: $50day five6:15 a.m. — i'm hosting a meeting at 7, so i get up, get ready, and make coffee. after the meeting, i take a break to cook breakfast and then clean the house for half an hour. y. leaves for the office.11 a.m. — i make vegan chicken nuggets for lunch and sit on the couch reading articles about the fourth industrial revolution. i'm taking a short break from worrying about climate change, and instead am fretting about widening economic disparity and social unrest as a result of technological advancement. i hope our future robot overlords are generous enough to develop a san junipero and archive my consciousness in perpetual digital utopia.12 p.m. — i'm very snacky all day. our girl scout cookie order was delivered today, so i dig into those, mini mozzarella balls, mandarins, and a protein bar.1 p.m. — weekly one-on-one meeting with my boss. i ramble on about some content innovation ideas that popped into my head during the leadership session. she seems interested. i have an ulterior motive of lessening the impact of the confidential mega-project. my group is already resource-constrained, and on top of barely having enough writers for our current projects, i've become a bottleneck in the review process.5 p.m. — y. comes home excited about hanging out with her sister the next day. they both took friday off and her sister is driving in from the small town where she lives an hour away. we haven't seen much of her for the past year due to covid. she's a teacher and is frequently exposed to small-town anti-maskers. y.'s excitement turns to grumpiness when she's having trouble finding a restaurant with a covered patio. it's supposed to snow tomorrow, and they need to sit outside for covid safety. frustrated with google results, she drives downtown to location-scout in person.6 p.m. — i do some couponing then pry myself off the couch to go grocery shopping. i pick up a bunch of fruit, veggies, salad mix, eggs (our chickens don't lay in winter), crackers, various cheeses (the store is sold out of feta, thanks to a tiktok video, but i get brie and sharp cheddar for valentine's charcuterie), bread, sour cream, and chips. $75.657 p.m. — i unload groceries then make buffalo cauliflower wings and quinoa for dinner. we watch more of the sinner while we eat. later, y. goes to read in bed and i stay up with my favorite hate-watch tv show: mtv's catfish. their covid format is kinda boring. there's still plenty to hate, though.daily total: $75.65day six8:30 a.m. — y. couldn't get to sleep last night and moved out to the living room couch, which meant i could starfish across the entire bed. i planned to wake up early and have a slow, leisurely morning, but instead, i wake up late and then have a leisurely morning anyway. it snowed a bunch overnight.9 a.m. — sister-in-law arrives. she and y. go sit together out on the back porch. one of my handy wife's summer projects was remodeling our covered patio; we added comfy outdoor sectional furniture, but never got around to installing a radiant heating system for winter, so it's ultra-chilly out there. they load up with blankets and coffee and chat for a couple of hours before leaving for lunch.9:30 a.m. — i work on reinvesting the funds i freed up from my espp. after researching megatrends over my holiday break, i've been building positions in a variety of specialized etfs focused on clean energy, ai, robotics, genomics, cybersecurity, infrastructure, fintech, weed, and esports. i move about $4,000 into my favorites.12:30 p.m. — stress-eat my lunch (sandwich) while untangling an urgent request that seems difficult but turns out not to be too bad. a winter storm warning pops up on my phone promising an additional four to six inches of snow the next day. y. and i had planned to drive an hour away to bring our nephew gifts for his sixth birthday on saturday, but driving is supposed to be ""difficult to impossible,"" so we reschedule for monday (which we all have off for president's day).3 p.m. — my co-workers nominate me to be profiled as a ""woman of inspiration"" for international women's week. impostor syndrome kicks in to question if this nomination is ironic — lately, i feel like more of a bartleby the scrivener than a sheryl sandberg, but i'm flattered regardless and i submit the requested info.5 p.m. — got a notice in the mail that our mortgage payments are increasing to cover escrow. it's happened every year. our house has nearly tripled in value since i bought it in 2013; in today's market, you would be lucky to find an empty lot in a sketchy part of town at the price i paid for this three-bedroom on a double lot. the annual property tax increase is something i didn't anticipate as a homebuyer — i thought as long as i had a fixed-rate apr, my mortgage payments would stay roughly the same.6 p.m. — i bake a pasta dish for dinner, with spinach, herbs, veggie crumbles, and a blend of cheeses. i think it's delicious but y. isn't into it. i tell her she should fire her personal chef. we eat girl scout cookies for dessert and watch the dead don't die, a zombie apocalypse comedy that got mostly bad reviews...but it hits me just right, i think it's hilarious. after the movie, we bundle up and take a walk. the neighborhood is silent, bright with snow, and it feels like christmastime. my glasses fog up every time we pause to kiss.10 p.m. — y. goes to bed, and i stay up listening to asmr and reading ark fund's big ideas 2021 innovation research. ark manages three of the etfs in my investment portfolio. their research and predictions are fascinating, and i love that their fortune teller in chief is a woman. 12:45 a.m. — after dozing off on the couch i finally get ready for bed, let the dogs out to potty, then relocate to the bedroom. unfortunately, now i am wide awake and restless, so two of the dogs and i move back to the couch for more asmr and scrolling reddit into the wee hours of the morning. daily total: $0day seven10 a.m. — more snow accumulated, about eight inches deep and growing. i step into snow boots and wade out to tend the chickens and bring them treats. i'm glad y. covered their run this year so they have more than just the coop to stretch out in on snow days.10:30 a.m. — warm up with coffee, the newspaper, and a living weighted blanket made of dogs. send galentine's day messages to a few of my favorite land mermaids. after y. wakes up, i make breakfast: eggs and avocado toast with veggie bacon. we decide to open our valentine's day gifts a day early. she got me a bottle of cult + king tonik (a root spray that does wonderful things for my hair), and i got her a kit for growing mushrooms, a handmade bar of soap, and some artisan chocolates.2 p.m. — i make salads with tomato and mozzarella for lunch. we find out that the senate acquitted trump in his impeachment hearing. not surprised, but certainly disappointed. can't wait for history to judge those complicit senators.3 p.m. — we suit up in snow gear and set out to make a snowman. the snow is not cooperating, it just crumbles. we make the tiniest, saddest snowman, with gravel eyes and a twig mouth, then take a short neighborhood walk in the snow.6:15 p.m. — stop by a coffee shop to pick up a couple of peppermint mochas ($10) on our way to a day-before-valentine's date night. we buy tickets ($20) to a drive-in movie special: a punk puppet zombie musical projected on the side of a truck in a vacant lot down by the river. pinnacle of romance, no? our local zero-waste market distributes pre-ordered appetizer boxes ($30 with tip). this is our first date out in the real world since last fall when the weather was mild enough that we could dine al fresco. we've had some extremely creative and fun lockdown date nights, but damn, it feels good to get proper dressed and leave the house. $606:45 p.m. — i spot a friend sitting in her car behind us. i send her some creepy texts and zombie emojis. she and her friend pop out for a masked chat before the movie.7:30 p.m. — the movie is so great. we're getting really into the audience participation — flashing brake lights for blood splatter, hazard lights for booze, etc. the snack box is awesome, too: a coffin-shaped chunk of brie, heart-shaped housemade crackers, chevre with blood orange marmalade, deviled eggs with pimiento olives (made to look like eyeballs), movie popcorn cookies, and ""sweet brains"" raspberry treats.8:45 p.m. — we stop at a drive-thru to pick up beyond meat tacos and churros ($14). the dogs are beside themselves with joy when we return to our hermitage. we eat dinner, y. watches netflix, and i scroll instagram. we go to bed early, around 10:30. $14daily total: $74"
27,"today: an architectural designer who makes $54,000 per year and spends some of her money this week on macarons.occupation: architectural designerindustry: architecture age: 26location:

that's because my room is in the basement. i still have a window! and i honestly love it because i have my own bathroom, the privacy of being two floors away from everyone else's bedrooms, and a very short laundry haul.loans: $500-$700 pre-covid (voluntarily above the minimum)cell phone: $55, paid to my mother monthly to cover my half of a family planspotify: $10.71adobe creative cloud:

yes, how did you pay for it?i think my parents would have supported me if college was not my path. neither of them went to college or had any aspirations to do so. but, as it turns out, i've always been a huge nerd. i loved school and did very well at it. towards the end of middle school, my mom started instilling in me that college was absolutely an option for me and that by doing well at school, it could be more affordable/attainable. my mother's salary was lower than the tuition for any school i applied to, and i had no significant savings, so it very well might have been impossible for me to afford it without major loans. thankfully, i was accepted at a college that basically covers tuition and rent if your household income is below a threshold (through grants, not loans). i was incredibly lucky. i was the first in my family to go to college. i basically lived in a wealthy bubble for four years, which had some cognitive dissonance for me because both my parents went through hard job losses/financial struggles during that time. after college, i pursued a master of architecture, which is a professional degree needed to be an architect (similar to a jd or md). i took out a loan for my first year of graduate school (~$58,000) in 2016 because my first-year financial assistance was minimal. this was a huge stressor for me. i had never handled that level of money, let alone debt. i felt guilty because i had been given the chance to go to an amazing university on a full-ride and instead of doing the sensible thing like finding a job after, i chose to obtain another degree that is notoriously expensive, especially compared to architecture starting salaries. for the other 2.5 years of my graduate education, i worked very hard to not go into any more debt. tuition and rent were covered through a combination of merit fellowships, teaching assistantships, and taking an ra position in an undergrad dorm (free rent!). once i became an ra and didn't have rent costs anymore, i basically dumped my assistantship stipends into the loan ($1,200-$1,500 a month). i also have some amazing cousins who took an interest in helping my mom and me financially from time to time. overall, they probably contributed ~$15,000 towards paying down my loan over a few years. once i graduated and had to pay rent again, i lowered my monthly student loan payments to $500-$700/month so i could also build my savings, which were basically non-existent.growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? did your parent/guardian(s) educate you about finances?i grew up in a low-income, single-parent household. my dad was in my life socially but not financially, and he struggled at the end of his life with poverty and substance abuse. my mom made ends meet for the two of us. she was very open with me about her financial stress. sometimes i wish she had been a little less open because i grew up with a lot of anxiety about money as a kid and very little agency to do anything about it. we got by, but i was constantly worried we were one crisis away from losing everything. she taught me the basics (saving is good, credit card debt is bad), but i have learned about things like student loans, investing, budgeting, etc on my own since then.what was your first job and why did you get it?my true first job was babysitting, which i did all through middle and high school. i got it because my mother also babysat as a side gig to her main job and it was a logical way to introduce me to the idea of having a job/making and saving money. in high school, i also worked as a file clerk at an auto dealership and at old navy. flip flop days were the worst.did you worry about money growing up?see aforementioned childhood money anxiety lol. yes, definitely, and it wasn't until i was an adult and got serious about my own financial education that i felt like i had agency over my situation.do you worry about money now?compared to the first 25 years of my life, i worry much less now. after being in school for seven years, $54,000 feels like i'm rolling in money. but i do think about it almost constantly — i budget, plan, check my accounts, and check my debt regularly. i worry that my mother doesn't have enough or that i should be making more to help support her when the time comes. also, my partner is currently in law school and, after graduating, is going to be in an obscenely high debt/obscenely high income situation. so i also think a lot about what that will mean for us as we move in together, combine finances, etc.at what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?i basically stopped asking my mother for money unless i truly needed it after i went away to school at 17, but i was also in the massive financial safety net of my wealthy university. i'd say starting graduate school and taking on student loan debt felt like the first truly independent move for me, but i was also able to stay on my mother's health insurance until i turned 26. if i really fell on hard times, i could go home, but it would not be preferable and i would be a burden on my mom's finances.do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? if yes, please explain.yes, i have some wonderful cousins who took an interest in helping me and my mom financially through my schooling. in college, they would occasionally help me out with spending money or travel costs for summer programs. in graduate school, their contributions equaled about $15,000 of my loan. i also inherited $8,000 from my grandmother when she passed in 2009, some of which i used for braces. i received about $1,500 from my relatives when my father, who had no life insurance, passed in 2019.day one7:15 a.m. — wake up time! i live in a basement room that doesn't get a lot of light in the morning, so i use smart lights that fade on and simulate sunlight. i stumble to the bathroom to clean up for the day.7:30 a.m. — i turn on the rest of my lights and sit down at my desk to study. i'm currently slogging my way through the six exams required to become a licensed architect. i passed three exams last fall and i'm taking my fourth exam at the end of march. i typically study one or two hours a day and try to get that in before work when i can pull myself out of bed early enough. before 9, i close my study binder and head upstairs to make oatmeal, cut up some strawberries, and boil water for tea. i say hello to my housemate and his cat (the queen of the household) before heading up to my ""office."" one of our other housemates has been at home with her family since the pandemic started, which means there's a spare room where i can set up my desktop computer so i'm not a basement gremlin 24/7.9 a.m. — i get on teams for our morning team call. while my coworkers are chatting, i input the last of the info i needed for my tax returns and get those e-filed. i'm a little anal about filing my tax returns super early, but it feels good to get it out of the way. i file for free through olt since my income falls below their threshold, which is great. i dive back into my multiple ongoing projects for work!10:30 a.m. — i remember that i never paid my online bill for my last therapy appointment — whoops. i log into the telehealth portal and take care of that. i also email my therapist and ask to push our next appointment out a week. i'm anticipating this week will be quite busy already and i'm feeling pretty solid right now. $7012 p.m. — i warm up some awesome sweet potato chili that i made last night (thanks nyt cooking!!) and then listen in on a lunchtime talk on bike racks while eating and drafting an email to my boss. after lunch, i go out for a short run and shower. why did i only wait an hour after eating chili to go for a run?? no idea, but i don't recommend it. after, i settle in for an afternoon of work and meetings.6:20 p.m. — around christmas, i tried to order all of my christmas gifts from non-amazon sources, which was mostly fine, but it did lead to a package of books for my family being lost with usps for two months and, like odysseus weary and sea-worn returning home, it finally arrived yesterday!! after work, i package up belated presents for my mom and walk to fedex to ship them. for the record, i am still all for supporting usps, but the philadelphia distribution center has given me trust issues and i want to make sure this package gets to my mom promptly. after i get home, i make some annie's mac and cheese, study for a while longer, and make a valentine's day card for sunday! i head to bed around 11:30. $15.42daily total: $85.42day two7 a.m. — wake up, wash my face, and moisturize. i definitely have a disappointing skincare routine compared to a lot of people. i feel like i've never had the money to afford good quality skincare products. now that i could possibly invest in them, it's still hard to make the mental leap and tell myself that it's an okay purchase to make. this is a frequent problem i have. i curl back up in bed and review some of my study flashcards. i also definitely fall asleep for 15 more minutes.8:15 a.m. — it's snowy and cold today so i make some challah french toast for breakfast. while i eat, i add a new post to the joint instagram i have with my boyfriend, c. we recently became avid birdwatchers and we made an account to share photos of some of the amazing birds we see! we really enjoy making the posts and adding facts about the birds, and hopefully, it's pleasurable for our ~100 followers (mostly friends and family).8:45 a.m. — today i am comparing tile and flooring samples with a coworker for some apartments we're working on, which means it's a very rare day in which i actually have to go into the office! i put on real clothes and some makeup (possibly for the first time this year??). normally on cold mornings, i'd take the bus in, but i make the 30-minute walking trek instead as per covid.12 p.m. — it's so weird being back in the office! after a morning of testing cabinet and flooring combinations with a coworker, we break for lunch. i warm up more chili and hide in one of the private phone call rooms where i can close the door and feel comfortable taking off my masks. today was payday (yay!) and it's my non-rent paycheck, so i pay off my monthly credit card bill and send my half of our family phone plan to my mom. i also move a big chunk into my savings account and a much smaller chunk to my ira.6 p.m. — classic day as a young architect: prepare a bunch of things for a meeting that your boss delays indefinitely and eventually just moves to tomorrow. oh well! at least i got to hang out with another co-worker all day. on the walk home, i pick up my farm share box from my neighbor's porch. i get bi-monthly produce boxes from philly foodworks, which is an awesome organization that has been pulling its weight hard in the pandemic. i unpack my box of fruits, veggies, and tofu at home and warm up leftover mac and cheese for dinner. the foodworks charge hits my account pretty soon after that. $40.296:30 p.m. — i hop on a zoom call with three of my friends from boston. we have had a weekly call during the pandemic to catch up and watch trashy tv. right now we're watching are you the one, which is an absolute mess. these calls have been really wonderful for me; i moved to philly shortly before the pandemic to be closer to my partner, but moving away from friends and then also being in quarantine has felt extra isolating. i'm lucky to have great roommates, coworkers, and my partner though! after, i make some herbal tea, study for another hour or so, and then play on the switch for a while. c. bought me sos friends of mineral town as an early valentine's day present (i played so many harvest moon games growing up!) and it's been so fun to get into it again.daily total: $40.29day three7 a.m. — you know the morning drill by now. wake up, wash up, early-morning studying. i make tea and chop up an apple for my oatmeal. while all the water boils, i wipe down the counters and table in the kitchen. my roommates are pretty considerate and clean, but with everyone working from home for a year, the kitchen is definitely in need of a deep clean. i make a mental note to discuss either doing that together or bringing in a cleaner (something we did monthly pre-covid).9 a.m. — i log on to my office's morning call. this morning is a lot of administrative talk. i spend the rest of the morning picking up edits on a drawing set we're working on for an apartment tower project. it's pretty independent work so i can listen to music and crank it out. i've been listening to a lot of rising appalachia this week, such talented women!!12:15 p.m. — i break for lunch, go for another run (this time before eating), take a shower, and warm up some chili. while on my run, edible arrangements delivers a box to my house! my mom sent it to c. and me for valentine's day and it has chocolate-covered strawberries and brownies (my favorites!!). so sweet of her. i put the box in the fridge and send her a thank you text. i feel bad that i didn't send her anything for valentine's day, but all my delayed christmas presents are being delivered to her today so that kind of counts, right?7:30 p.m. — after a hectic day with another in-person meeting in the evening, it's time for the best part of my week!! c. picks me up outside the office, we grab takeout ramen ($16.06 for my half), and we head back to my apartment. c. and i live separately, but it was much easier to get between our apartments in the pre-covid days of public transportation and warm biking weather. now we tend to spend the week apart at our own places and concentrate our time together over the weekend. it's good for both of our productivity (c. is in law school and is swamped with work), but i miss him a lot throughout the week. we catch up over ramen and i give him a very usps-delayed christmas gift (obama's new book!). after, i show him my farm on harvest moon, we fall asleep. $16.06daily total: $16.06day four8:30 a.m. — slooow wakeup with c. but we have big plans today!! we make some oatmeal and fried eggs and head out for the day.10:30 a.m. — we like to celebrate valentine's day (and any holidays really) by trying out new fancy recipes together so we head to whole foods with a list of ingredients. i really hate the whole foods in my neighborhood and try to avoid it at all costs, especially in the pandemic. but when you need a bunch of specialty ingredients and want to pick up wine as well, it's the best nearby option. we double-mask up with kn95s and brave the saturday morning chaos. one hour and many nerves later, we load up $80 of groceries and $50 of wine and beer into the car ($40 and $25 for my half). highlights include some local beer-washed goat cheese, chocolate macarons, beyond meat burgers, and one large baguette. $6512 p.m. — we arrive at an arboretum in north philly for a really fun event! there's an amazing organization in philadelphia called philly goat project, which is a non-profit that offers its fourteen goats for animal therapy, sustainable grazing, and special needs/youth education. we bought tickets for their valentine's day happy hour fundraiser a couple of weeks ago ($60 total). we spend two hours hanging out with the goats (masked and outdoors), drinking beers that we brought, and learning about the organization from the volunteers who work there. c. buys a beanie and a raffle ticket, and we win some abstract ""goat art"" created by one of the goats. at the end, we get to take a couple of goats on a ""romantic goat walk"" around the arboretum. it's so fun and wholesome (even in the freezing cold) and we definitely plan on supporting them again in the future.3:30 p.m. — back home and thoroughly cold, we make tea and put together a picnic lunch from some of our whole foods haul (cheese, crackers, strawberries, etc) and eat it sitting in bed and watching taskmaster. if you haven't seen taskmaster, it's all on youtube and it's hysterical. also another book that i had been waiting on from usps arrived!! this is the first time since thanksgiving that i am no longer waiting on packages from the usps. amazing.7 p.m. — we had a late lunch and aren't quite ready for dinner yet, so we watch the first 90 minutes of the seventh harry potter movie ($4.23). we were both big hp fans growing up and realized we'd never watched it together, so we've been watching one or two movies a weekend for a month now. it's a huge disappointment that j.k. rowling turned out to be a super problematic person, but the movies really hold up and bring back all sorts of memories of reading the books and going to midnight releases as a kid. $4.238:30 p.m. — we take a break to make dinner. tonight we're trying a recipe for edamame ravioli out of a cookbook that my roommate gave me for my birthday. it's all philly-area chefs and recipes from their restaurants, which is super cool. the edamame ravioli is from a restaurant called buddakan, which is super popular. it takes a while to make (lots of filling wonton wrappers), but in the end, it's so good. we eat it in the kitchen, offer some ravioli to my roommate, and finish off the bottle of wine that we opened for the ravioli sauce. afterward, we finish the hp movie and head to bed around 12:30.daily total: $69.23day five9 a.m. — i wake up, wash up, and then promptly get back in bed with c. and wish him a happy valentine's day. we cuddle, scroll instagram, and show each other memes and pictures of birds for a while. this is actually the first weekend in a long time that we aren't birdwatching, which typically means waking up much earlier.10:30 a.m. — we make some eggs and challah toast. c. has some law school work to do today, so we sit at the kitchen table and i study, catch up on emails, and drink tea while he works. i also give my mom a call to thank her for the edible arrangement and tell her about the goats.1:30 p.m. — we take a break from work and go for a walk. we grab chai lattes from my favorite nearby coffee shop ($4.25) and make a big loop around the neighborhood. we stop at the outdoor window for the hardware/home goods store. we head home, warm up some leftover ravioli for lunch, and continue with working/studying/laundry/etc. $4.255 p.m. — we finish with productivity for the day and play a game of wingspan, our favorite board game. it actually fueled our interest in birdwatching in the first place. we've played over 100 times in the pandemic and c. keeps a spreadsheet of our scores. yes, we are that nerdy. tonight c. wins, but just barely!! we also exchange valentine's day gifts, which are mostly bird-themed this year.6 p.m. — we start our evening cooking adventures. our (eclectic) menu consists of french onion soup, dandan noodles (with a recipe from dandan in philly!), and lava cake (a v-day tradition). it takes us about three hours to make it all, but cooking together is one of our favorite activities and it's a ton of fun. the food all comes out pretty great and we have enough leftovers to share with my roommate and last us for lunch all week.9:30 p.m. — we make some tea and watch the last harry potter movie! we get to bed around 1 a.m. this was a super nice valentine's day weekend. $4.23daily total: $8.48day six8:30 a.m. — c. and i roll out of bed just in time to get dressed, make oatmeal, and boil tea for our respective 9 a.m. calls. definitely no chance of studying this morning. c. decides to stay for the day and work next to my desk, which is always really nice.9 a.m. — i spend the morning typing up notes from all our meetings last week and coming up with a gameplan with my coworker on how to tackle our tasks this week. the pace on our project is really picking up, but it felt like we got some crucial decisions over with last week which is encouraging.12 p.m. — after a flurry of morning coordination emails, i take a lunch break and go for a run. it's mid-thirties today, which is a pleasant change after running in ~20-degree weather last week. after, i warm up the very last of my sweet potato chili (which, by this point, i am very sick of), chat with my roommate a bit, and get back to my desk. i start feeling pretty nauseous around 3...might have let that chili live for too long.6 p.m. — i log off for the day and c. and i warm up leftover dandan noodles and steam some bok choy. we watch another episode of taskmaster with dinner. after, i prepare for an 8 p.m. college admissions interview call. for the past few years, i've volunteered as an alumna to interview prospective applicants who are applying to my undergrad alma mater. i really enjoy it — the kids are always so talented, enthusiastic, and excited about what they may do in college. i don't think my reviews of the students affect the admissions process very much, but i try to advocate for particularly inspiring students that i interview. the student i speak with tonight is really sweet. i can't imagine trying to plan for your future in the middle of a pandemic, so i'm very impressed by their attitude.8:30 p.m. — after i finish the interview, i play some more nintendo switch while c. finishes up his emails for the day. around 10, we warm up hot chocolate and the brownies my mom sent and read a chapter of the subtle knife out loud together before going to bed around 11.daily total: $0day seven7:15 a.m. — i manage to pull myself out of bed even though i'd rather just continue cuddling with c. i wash up and spend an hour studying building codes at my desk while c. keeps sleeping. it's actually quite nice and cozy. after i finish a chapter, i crawl back in bed for a few more minutes.8:45 a.m. — we get up for real this time and throw together some oatmeal and tea. i head upstairs for my morning call and dive into work again. i'm trying to figure out what medicine cabinet we need to use and where it needs to be placed in all of our apartment units. sometimes architecture is about designing inspiring buildings, sometimes it's about the mounting height of a medicine cabinet.12 p.m. — i break for lunch and warm up the leftover french onion soup for c. and me. we eat and then pack up his stuff and his half of all the food we made this weekend. we say goodbye and he heads back to his place for the week. i'll likely see him again on friday. it was extra nice having him here until tuesday and i know i'll be a little lonely the rest of the afternoon. i hop on a client meeting call to take meeting minutes. the rest of the afternoon is spent editing those and coordinating a couple of tasks with my coworkers. i take a break at some point to look up the price of flights in august and dream about when we can go on faraway vacations again.6:30 p.m. — i go out for a walk around the neighborhood and have a long phone call with my best friend. it's way colder than i expected, so i cut my walk short and fold laundry until our call finishes up. my aunt gave me airpods for christmas and i've never had good bluetooth headphones before, so i still get a lot of novelty out of completing tasks while on long phone calls. it's the simple things sometimes.8 p.m. — i warm up the last of my dandan noodles and hard boil a couple of eggs to go on top. the rest of the night is spent studying a little longer, writing up a review of the student i interviewed yesterday, and chatting with my roommate in the kitchen while finishing off some halo top ice cream. i finish the night with more harvest moon and then fall asleep.daily total: $0"

setting yourself up for an independent life.did you worry about money growing up?yes. i was never sure i would have everything i needed.do you worry about money now?yes. i lost my job recently. i have some cash and i know i could liquidate some stocks and draw down on my accounts, but that would be a last resort.at what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?i was responsible for myself at 22. i am my own financial safety net.do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? if yes, please explain.no.day one9 a.m. — i wake up after pressing snooze a couple of times. time to start the day. i lost my job recently and am very burnt out. i plan on resting up and doing things that feel good while still tackling a couple of things a day. working to find balance is a lifelong pursuit.9:30 a.m. — after brushing my teeth, washing my face, slapping on sunscreen, and taking my medications and supplements, i walk and feed my dog. it's finally cold in d.c.9:45 a.m. — i grab a cold brew out of the fridge to sip while checking my emails and check all the virtual pings i've missed. i have a 1:30 p.m. call with a professional contact and the window repair people are slated to arrive anytime between 1 and 4 p.m. to give me a quote on what it will cost me to repair the windows. the rest of the day i can chill and watch tv while knitting.11 a.m. — i'm hungry, so i reheat leftover chicken soup and decide to make more. i chop up the vegetables, add chicken stock and shredded chicken, and get that going on the stove. i clean as i go and do dishes and clean out old food in the fridge.12 p.m. — throw out trash, walk my dog, and chat on the phone with family.1:15 p.m. — time flies whether or not you're on a tight work schedule! another family member calls to encourage me. it's nice to know i have people to talk to. as with many, many people, it's been a year for me.2:01 p.m. — ahh! just missed the call from the window repair company while i was on the phone with my colleague. i call them back and they've already been rerouted, so they'll try again tomorrow morning. hungry again. hot bowl of soup it is! i'm not someone who gets sick of eating the same meals, so i eat a lot of meals on repeat. i'm also not a person who likes to spend a lot of time meal planning, so this approach to nourishing myself works for me.2:40 p.m. — after soup, fruit, and doing the dishes, i am ready to netflix and knit!7 p.m. — i take a break from knitting to walk and feed the dog and text with friends.11 p.m. — shower, brush teeth, skincare routine, and sleep.daily total: $0day two8:50 a.m. — i wake up to very loud construction noises. i mindlessly go through the motions — brush teeth, wash face, moisturize and sunscreen face, meds and supplements, walk the dog, pick up her poop, and feed her.9:20 a.m. — i make pour-over coffee today. i check my email, consult my to-do list, and follow up with a recruiter i interviewed with last week. i also pitch an idea for a story to a favorite website.11:15 a.m. — lunch of soup. i do dishes while it heats up.11:30 a.m. — the window people are here! everyone's masked up! i hope the estimate isn't too high. owning property to build equity is a great way to build wealth, but there are always plenty of expenses to plan for.11:45 a.m. — after lunch of soup topped off with an apple, i call a foreign currency exchange service. i have several euros leftover from a europe trip i've put off exchanging to u.s. dollars (usd) for years. no idea why. inertia maybe? now is a good time to tackle the errands and chores i've put off to do some other day. some other day is today! or not. the place is closed today, so i plan on going tomorrow.12:30 p.m. — i walk my dog and head out to drop off a package at the post office to start a return. $3.901 p.m. — it's gorgeous out. i love running errands on foot when the weather is this lovely. at the grocery store, i pick up olive oil, soy sauce, small red beans, black beans, wasabi, mandarins, honeycrisp apples, cilantro, limes, ginger root, and onions. $39.472:15 p.m. — i'm finally home. i greet my pup and check my iphone health app. i walked 2.5 miles. it's amazing how moving my body elevates my mood and spirits.3:15 p.m. — time to netflix and knit.5:30 p.m. — i get on my laptop to attend my psychiatrist appointment over zoom ($275). this is an unsustainable expense going forward while i'm not working, but for now, it's an essential expense. like many psychiatrists, my psychiatrist doesn't take insurance. i pay cash. $2757 p.m. — dinner of soup and two mandarin oranges. i walk and feed my dog afterward.7:45 p.m. — i'm already exhausted. wash face, do my minimal skincare routine, brush, and floss. off to bed i go.daily total: $318.37day three8:45 a.m. — wake up, wash face, brush teeth, moisturize and sunscreen, take meds and supplements, walk and feed my dog, and make coffee. i search for a sliding cabinet organizer from target since i have a gift card there and i'm finally sick of knocking over cleaning products when reaching in this deep cabinet to find an item. i find one that fits the specs of my cabinet ($52.07 on gift card). there are a few things i want to get done around my home, so i buy a stud finder, painter's tape, a ring light (for interviews), and a couple of other household items on amazon ($54.31). while i shop online, i see an email requesting interviews next week; i email back with available times. $54.3111:20 a.m. — lunch! soup and apple. i walk my dog, pick up a package, and head back home. the package was for flowers a good friend of mine sent to cheer me up. i pack up a couple of gifts i purchased online that were underwhelming and print out return labels.12:40 p.m. — i leave my apartment to exchange foreign currencies for usd. i receive $266 (after paying $10 in fees) and drop off a package to return. on my way home, i see that i have another package waiting for me. this time, it's a plush blanket and robe. there's no card, but i'm pretty certain i know who sent it. i text my friend to thank her and sure enough, it was her. $101:45 p.m. — home. i putz around the house and end up cleaning and organizing my space a bit.4:30 p.m. — starving. i finish the last of the soup and reach for bread to toast and eat with the tuna salad i made recently. the bread went bad, so i eat the tuna by itself. i also eat a mandarin and persimmon.11 p.m. — brush teeth and turn in.daily total: $64.31day four7:10 a.m. — i wake up early to construction noises. c'mon, guys! it's saturday! i had a terrible night's sleep last night, so i stay in bed to try to get more sleep.8:30 a.m. — same deal. brush teeth, wash face, take meds, do dishes, make coffee. my dog is fast asleep, so i drag my feet getting it together to walk her. i post things to sell online. this is another thing i've put off while focused on other things. i have a lot of clutter since i haven't re-homed things in a while.11:15 a.m. — i'm hungry. i finished the soup yesterday, so i make a smoothie out of ingredients in my freezer. i always keep frozen fruit in my freezer and ingredients like ground flaxseed meal and oats in my pantry for quick smoothies. after lunch, i walk and feed my dog.12 p.m. — it's official. i am grumpy from sleeping poorly and being subjected to construction noises all morning. i decide to take it easy and not push myself to get things done.5:30 p.m. — i make a salad of tomato, kale, and avocado with a red wine vinaigrette. i eat two mandarins and chocolate for dessert. more knitting while watching tv. i'd like to finish my current knitting project to send as a holiday gift, but i'm not rushing to get it done either.12 a.m. — brush teeth, wash face, skincare, crash.daily total: $0day five8 a.m. — i wake up to a text from a friend who lives in my building complaining about construction noises. i know, girl. it's been incessant. i wish i could get out of the city and shelter-in-place in a cabin some place quiet, but unfortunately, i don't have the money to spend on a getaway. we're all just doing our best to get through the year and sometimes that means being safe at home while neighbors repair or renovate their homes. i do the things i do every morning to get ready to start the day.12:45 p.m. — a good friend in my quaranteam comes by with taco bell and persimmons.2:40 p.m. — after lunch, we take a walk since it's nice out and wave goodbye. it's nice to hang out in person. i'm pretty good at enjoying my own company and staying home overall, but it does get tedious. and we are at mile 22 of this, with 4.2 more miles to go.8:30 p.m. — i get hungry, so i eat the rest of the tacos and eat a persimmon. i get concerned that i've eaten very little fiber today, so i wash it down with a psyllium husk drink (metamucil without the color or flavoring). see? balance.daily total: $0day six8:20 a.m. — up, brush teeth, wash face, moisturize and sunscreen, take meds, make coffee, eat a persimmon. walk and feed my dog.11:25 a.m. — i make a smoothie for lunch and buy a girlfriend collective shipping label to recycle some clothes in exchange for credit. $72:30 p.m. — i call a professional contact to chat about the interview i have coming up. it was definitely difficult to get used to ""networking"" and maintaining professional relationships, but once i got over the initial discomfort, it became a normal part of my work life. for people who feel hesitant about networking, i think the important thing to focus on is that these relationships are genuine and authentic. i'm also here to support my contacts and be there for them in return as a sounding board, professional reference, or for advisement.3:10 p.m. — a friend calls me to catch up on the phone when i get back from walking my dog. it's nice to keep in touch with old friends. as i get older, i value my established relationships more and more.6 p.m. — i'm hungry and finally feel like making more soup. i chop vegetables to make another vat of chicken soup. i eat some mandarins while i cook.8:30 p.m. — christmas honestly snuck up on me this year. what even is time, you know? i decide to buy a few things. i purchase a kitchen tool for a friend ($29.15), a virtual experience for a family member ($52.08), and macadamia honey nut butter for two friends ($43.98). $125.2110 p.m. — i finally eat chicken soup. i save a few pieces of boiled chicken for my dog, who happily gobbles it up. i eat two more mandarin oranges and chocolate.3:30 a.m. — i wake up in a fully lit apartment. i fell asleep while watching tv, so i didn't wash up yet. i get up to wash my face and moisturize and go back to sleep. too tired to brush my teeth.daily total: $132.21day seven8 a.m. — i wake up to light construction noises. i really hope it's not too distracting during my video interviews today. brush teeth, shower, take meds and supplements, make coffee. i soak my completed knitting project in a wool wash. since i finished in time for christmas, i need to wash and dry it right away.10:50 a.m. — over coffee, i decide to tile my kitchen backsplash. i make an order on amazon ($31.69) and on home depot ($167.77) for supplies. $199.4612 p.m. — i receive a quote from the window repair place. they quote me about $500. time to get two more estimates. i make a smoothie and walk my dog.1 p.m. — i get ready for the interviews by doing my makeup and pulling my hair back professionally. one of the perks of working from home this year was saving time commuting and getting dressed. it can be so time-consuming (not to mention costly) to look ""professional,"" whatever that means.4 p.m. — i'm wiped out from interviews. i need to write thank you emails, but i'm feeling brain dead. i always try to write thoughtful emails that clearly demonstrate that i listened actively and am a capable professional.5 p.m. — i send both thank you emails. i cannot believe it's already 5 p.m.6:30 p.m. — i print more return labels, walk and feed my dog, wash the makeup off my face and moisturize, and nuke chicken soup in the microwave. i top it off with, you guessed it, persimmon and chocolate for dessert.7:30 p.m. — i do laundry while i chat with a friend. overall, it's been a tough time for me, but i'm grateful for my health and safety and my loved ones.daily total: $199.46savings vary. see straighttalk.com."

daddonations: $10 to the aclu, $20 to black visions collective car insurance: $440 every six months was there an expectation for you to attend higher education? did you participate in any form of higher education? if yes, how did you pay for it?my parents always expected me to go to college and they saved for both my brother and me to help us do so. as a college student, i did not fully appreciate their support and many years of planning that made this possible. i know i am very privileged to have had so much help paying for my college. in the rest of my money diary, i think you'll be able to see how that help has already influenced my financial stability and ability to obtain wealth. i've worked hard, but this is also a story of how generational wealth works. i had about $25,000 of student debt after attending a private college. i paid that debt off in three years by moving back in with my parents for two years after graduating and working two jobs consistently. the most significant reason i am debt-free is because my parents contributed a total of $30,000 to my college education. i also took college-level classes in high school and was able to graduate from college in three years. i was also an ra for my last two years of college, so i did not pay for housing.growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? did your parent/guardian(s) educate you about finances?we didn't talk a lot about our family's money growing up. we were fairly frugal in everyday life, often buying on sale and such, but we had a nice house and went on family vacations. my parents did frequently talk to me about managing the money i was earning/receiving from them. now, i call my parents with financial questions and asked them a lot of questions when buying my first house.what was your first job and why did you get it?when i was 14, i started working as an assistant dance teacher a couple of hours a week. i got paid in class credits and it helped my parents with the astronomical cost of dance. i continued to do that job until i graduated high school. i also got a job at a local sporting goods store at 16. i typically worked about eight hours a week. this job was really just for extra spending money.did you worry about money growing up?my family was financially very comfortable while i was growing up. i never worried about money, with one exception for a brief period of time when my dad lost his job. the most significant expense was that my parents paid for many hours of dance lessons for me every week.do you worry about money now?i was unexpectedly laid off from my first job out of college and i do worry about losing my income like that again. other than that, i am privileged to not worry very much about money.at what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?when i turned 16, my parents wanted to instill financial responsibility in me, so they started a new system: they gave me $150 per month and i was now responsible for all of my day-to-day expenses (they still paid for my dance classes and dance costume fees). i paid for my own gas, car repairs, toiletries, school supplies, clothes, going to the movies with friends, etc. i do think this system taught me to budget and manage my money well from a young age. i quickly learned to buy store-brand items and to skip the expensive movie theater popcorn sometimes. it was also very safe. i realize that many people have to learn these skills in a stressful way out of necessity. i always knew i had a safety net and i know i still do with my parents and my large extended family.do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? if yes, please explain.aside from the $150 per month i received as a teenager, i haven't received any passive income.day one8 a.m. — woo it's friday! i wake up begrudgingly because i stayed up until 2 a.m. reading such a fun age. mornings are hard for me in general. after my very basic morning routine of throwing on leggings and a turtleneck, washing my face, brushing my teeth, putting contacts in, and piling my hair up on top of my head with a scrunchie, i reheat some leftover quinoa, add brown sugar, cinnamon, and blueberries. i make myself some of the nice coffee i bought from a local co-op last week. it's more expensive than what i typically buy ($13 for a bag), but it's really the little things getting me through covid times. time for work (from home)!12 p.m. — three zoom meetings in a row and i'm ready for a break. i take stock of the leftovers in my fridge and dump the last of the leftover quinoa, some cooked sweet potato slices, and some seasoned tofu from dinner last night into a pan. i add spring mix and pour lemon vinaigrette salad dressing over the top. not bad for an impromptu meal. i realize i have an almost overdue bill for my appliance insurance and write out a check for $45 (monthly expenses). i bought my first house six months ago and many of the appliances are o.l.d. like so old they almost have a vintage cool look now. i like the peace of mind and predictable expense the insurance provides, plus these dinosaur appliances are also really well made so who knows if they'll ever actually need to be replaced.3 p.m. — it's officially work from the couch o'clock. i make tea and snack on some plain greek yogurt with honey and blueberries.4:30 p.m. — i head over to my friend, d.'s, house. she is collecting period products for a local youth shelter for her birthday. i pick up some tampons, pads, and liners on the way. i also bring her my last bottle of homemade orange, grapefruit, vanilla-infused wine. we chat outside for a few minutes with masks, but it's pretty cold so it doesn't last long. it's still good to see her in real life. $16.745 p.m. — i stop to do a contactless pick up of some cute vintage cabinet knobs i saw listed on facebook marketplace ($2). i am obsessed with facebook marketplace for furniture, decor, home improvement tools, etc. i love a good deal and buying used so it's a win-win. $26 p.m. — i start cooking some wild rice as my roommate, b., arrives home. she says she is ordering some tacos for pick up and asks if i want some. twenty minutes earlier, i definitely would have taken her up on it, but i opt to finish making a rice bowl instead. b. and i were introduced through a mutual friend when we were both looking for new housing two years ago. we lived together in an apartment with a third roommate for two years before i bought this house. b. is a great roommate, so i was glad when she wanted to move in with me! i know i am too extroverted to enjoy living alone and sharing costs makes it much more manageable to afford my mortgage and utilities. it also gives me some extra money to work on home repairs and improvements.7:30 p.m. — i hop on a zoom call with two of my closest friends (from college) who are in different states. covid has actually allowed us to connect more since we are all more tech-savvy now and there aren't in-person friend gatherings getting in the way. we do yoga together and then proceed to our planned activity of the night — simultaneously making flourless chocolate cake. i open a bottle of red wine for the occasion. the cake is amazing and we have a thorough catch-up.1 a.m. — i get ready for bed after a burst of energy inspired me to clean my room. i almost always have energy at night like this.daily total: $18.74day two7:30 a.m. — my alarm goes off. usually, i like to sleep in on weekends, but i have a second job teaching dance and i am helping out with choreography this morning. i make coffee and grab a bag of homemade trail mix on my way out the door.11:30 a.m. — it feels nice to have been awake and moving my body for a couple of hours already. i hop in the car and call my partner, l. he lives an hour and a half away and we call our relationship an ""inconvenient distant relationship."" i am going to his house today so i fill up my car ($31.81) and hit the road. $31.811 p.m. — i arrive at l.'s and am feeling very creative from this morning's choreography session. i spend another hour working on some material for my classes this week. i eat some of the egg bake l. made this morning. he's a great cook and isn't afraid of slow-to-cook meals where i am kind of impatient.5 p.m. — we're hungry and it's just starting to snow so we order pizza for pick up ($17.25 plus a $5 tip). we have a tradition of pizza and wine nights so we stop to pick up a bottle of wine too ($12). l. pays for both of these things. we have a very informal system of taking turns paying for things.6 p.m. — we get a little wine drunk and have several spirited and random conversations. later we rent mlk/fbi on amazon prime (i pay). it's interesting but we're both tired and call it a night around midnight. $6.99daily total: $38.80day three6:30 a.m. — l. wakes up because he likes mornings. luckily, he has mostly given up trying to convert me to his morning ways. at 9, i roll out of bed, grab coffee, and join l. on the couch. we finish watching the last bit of the documentary and eat leftover egg bake.11 a.m. — the fresh snow has inspired us to go out cross-country skiing. we both recently got our own pairs (l.'s as a birthday gift from me and mine from facebook marketplace for $40). it's turning out to be a great pandemic hobby. we pack up our gear and…. my car won't start. i knew i was on the verge of needing a new battery and we're supposed to have below zero temps next week. luckily, an auto parts store a couple of blocks away has the battery i need and the new one is in within 30 minutes. $182.5212 p.m. — skiing is back on! we drive about 20 minutes to a county park with trails that are free to ski. the sun is shining and it is quite busy. luckily there is plenty of space.2:30 p.m. — i feel so good after moving my body and getting some sun. it feels like i never see the light of day in the winter sometimes. l. and i decide to both head back to my house, but we have to drive separately because of our work schedules this week. i stop for a chai latte with almond milk, a coffee for l., and a doughnut on the way. $8.224:30 p.m. — we have definitely not eaten enough today, so we make some vegan chicken nuggets in the oven as a pre-dinner. i mix together sriracha and honey to create my favorite dipping sauce combo. i mostly eat vegetarian — partially because i just don't really like the taste of meat and also for environmental reasons.7 p.m. — i shovel the sidewalk and do some cleaning while listening to the splendid table podcast. l. roasts some squash for dinner and i take over after getting inspired by the podcast. i have some lefse (a thin, potato-based tortilla-like swedish food) frozen and leftover from christmas and i decide to try to make it work with the squash. i make a greek yogurt thyme sauce and pile the lefse with the squash, tomatoes, spring mix, walnuts, and pickled onions. it's pretty good, though it's not quite the same as my holiday favorite of lefse slathered in butter and sugar.11 p.m. — i continue my cleaning spree while l. reads a book. we shower and crawl into bed. l. really does help me go to bed at a reasonable time.daily total: $190.74day four8 a.m. — i wake up worried that i have to move my car (by 8 a.m.) to not get towed when the snowplow comes through. luckily, l. has already moved our cars. i do my morning ""routine"" quickly and get ready for a 9 a.m.. meeting. l. has made eggs, toast, and coffee (bless him) and is working from my place today.12 p.m. — i sauté some onions and a yellow pepper and add in some leftover roasted squash and wild rice. l. makes a yummy yogurt sauce. i also eat some of the leftover flourless chocolate cake and it's sooo good.2 p.m. — we decide to get out of the house for a quick walk at a nearby park. we enjoy walking around the area and discover a brewery we didn't know existed. we aren't going out to eat inside restaurants right now, even though it has recently become allowed again, so i add it to a list on my phone of places to try later or when we can comfortably sit outside again. we make some microwave popcorn when we get back home.4:30 p.m. — done with job #1 for the day. i send b. a quick apology text for leaving the kitchen a disaster and make some tea to take with me as i'm running out the door.5:30 p.m. — i teach dance at this time on mondays and tuesdays. we are recently back to in-person classes after a shutdown. class sizes are small, distanced, and we all wear masks. it feels relatively safe and it is one million times better than teaching dance over zoom.9 p.m. — usually i snack between classes while teaching but now i don't really like to remove my mask aside from quick sips of water. i inhale a lemon lara bar on my drive home and listen to the local public radio station to catch up on news. i'm still hungry when i get home so i eat a bowl of cereal. i know this isn't the most nutritious dinner, but i'm exhausted and this is the reality on these long workdays. i catch up with b. who is a freelance writer as a second job and is writing at the kitchen table (we switch off in the nice office chair — it's mine during the day and hers at night). then i force myself to clean up the day's worth of mess in the kitchen, even though i am very tempted to just leave it for tomorrow.12 a.m. — i stretch for a few minutes and call l. to say goodnight before passing outdaily total: $0day five8 a.m. — i wake up to b. getting ready for work (she has to go into the office again after several work-from-home months). i have a killer tension headache so i shut off my alarm and pull my blanket over my head.9 a.m. — okay, i really have to get up now. i take a quick steaming hot shower and drink some water to try to diffuse my tense neck and shoulders. i have a three-hour meeting that i have to rally for. i make a huge cup of coffee, throw on a button-up shirt, some joggers, and blue light glasses, and hop on the zoom call with wet hair. my workplace (a medium-sized nonprofit) has been very flexible and supportive throughout covid. i work with almost all women which i think is a huge win. it's not uncommon for someone to join a meeting with a toddler on their lap and we have gotten extra self-care days in response to both covid and after george floyd's murder this past summer, in addition to our generous pto policy. i know i'm lucky to have a workplace that recognizes that we're human (and that i can still work from home).11 a.m. — i make two pieces of toast with honey during a meeting break and i realize we're almost out of paper towels and dish soap. i have a new years' resolution to use less plastic and paper for household chores. i've started using grove to order household supplies since i haven't been able to find a local store that carries a full range of environmentally friendly household products. i add recycled plastic trash bags, tree-free paper towels, plastic-free hand soap and dish soap refills, and a pack of two walnut dish sponges. i decide to try out their reusable ""paper towel"" product to hopefully cut down on paper towel usage. shipping is free because i got a free year membership when they were doing a promotion. $37.701 p.m. — i remember the chicken enchiladas that i froze last week (thank you past self) and put them in the oven to cook for lunch. while scrolling on facebook i see that one of my friends who is a middle school teacher in a low-income area is raising money for technology for his students to use at home for distance learning. though i think it is ridiculous that he has to pull from his friends and family to fund the educational needs of his students, i chip in $25 because that's a systemic issue that can't be solved today. $253 p.m. — i make a smoothie with plain greek yogurt, frozen raspberries, almond milk, and orange juice as a snack along with some 88% dark chocolate (my fave). i've been super productive so far this afternoon and i'm hoping to keep up the momentum.4:30 p.m. — i change and leave for my second night of teaching this week. the beginnings of my weeks are always hectic like this. i was trying to avoid the afternoon caffeine, but i am feeling myself get sleepy during the drive, and that isn't going to fly, so i stop at caribou and order a mocha with almond milk. $4.2310 p.m. — i get home and chop up a pineapple, which i eat most of along with some cashews and hot cheetos.1 a.m. — oops, time for bed! i stayed up talking and laughing with b.

(i'm always excited to see him, but it's even more exciting now when he's one of the two people i see.)daily total: $62.77"

did you participate in any form of higher education? if yes, how did you pay for it?absolutely. culturally, we get master's degrees. it's a bare minimum. however, i did really enjoy school so i wasn't at odds with the decision until i got to grad school and hated it. racism and sexism abound! i earned my phd, which was fully funded. my parents helped to pay for my undergrad degree. 80% was funded by scholarships and the remaining 20% my parents paid for. i still feel guilty about this because i turned down full scholarships to go to my dream school, which did not offer full academic scholarships as they only offered need-based aid.growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? did your parent/guardian(s) educate you about finances?credit cards were to be used to build credit, not to purchase items that were too expensive to afford. if you couldn't afford it, you couldn't afford it. saving was emphasized. my parents invested through work accounts, but we never talked about investing. i learned a lot about investing from watching tv programs.what was your first job and why did you get it?i worked as a camp counselor. i wanted to earn spending money and to get out of the house in the summer. fortunately, i was never asked to help with family bills. i remember times when things were scary and we didn't have extra, but we had what we needed.did you worry about money growing up?yes, i heard discussions about finances and watched my parents balance the accounts. i am a worrier though, so i worried about everything.do you worry about money now?yes, i want to build additional income streams and know that will take more investments. i wonder if i am capable of doing it and if i will reach my goals. i work in a volatile industry and whispers of layoffs are frequent and scary.at what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?22, after college. though i worked in college, my parents paid for some of my schooling. i consider my roth ira my safety net. i walked through all the worst-case scenarios before i bought my duplex, and that was the conclusion i came to. i could pull from my ira if i go through my savings. this is not my plan, but a worst-case scenario.do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? if yes, please explain.none, unless i consider my parents help for college.day one8 a.m. — up and ready to stay in bed. i say a prayer of gratitude to be alive, ask for the willingness to be a decent person, and say ""thy will, not mine, be done."" i am very much struggling with who ""thy"" is, but for now, ""thy"" feels true to me. i have a few things i wanted to buy and decide to use this time in bed to get these items. let's hit it. i start with rei. i get winter gloves and breathable masks. i have a dividend and a gift card from when i signed up for the co-op over a year ago. total is $21.73 for me. next is target. i got a gift card for christmas. i get coconut butter sealant, bentonite clay, hair gel, con-air shears, and leave-in conditioner. total is $0 for me with the gift card. i am on a mission to take better care of myself and will start with my crown. $21.739:30 a.m. — i get up and out of bed for some push-ups. my gym is doing a 100 push-up challenge for 100 days. i debate ordering brunch from a small cafe nearby. i haven't been there before but they have an omelet with crab meat! i can't justify the $10 delivery on a $10 item. i think about adding to the order and having leftovers, but nothing on the menu seems like it will keep well. i can't believe how much time i spent debating this.10:30 a.m. — maybe i'll have a sweet potato? i think about food a lot. i was diagnosed with an eating disorder two years ago and have been in recovery for about six months. i manage with therapy, overeaters anonymous meetings, a food accountability partner, a sponsor, and outreach to oa friends. i also have depression. i feel guilty sometimes that i have so much ""wrong"" with me, but everyone has their shit. back to the sweet potato, is it a craving i'm trying to satisfy? is the craving an emotional need? i don't know. i just have some yogurt and try to forget it. i wonder what it is like to be normal around food.1 p.m. — i start cutting up veggies for meals this week. one recipe says it is optional to peel the potato and optional it shall remain. i also cut some onions, carrots, and broccoli. i compost the scraps. #naturebitch. i have a salad using none of the above ingredients :)2 p.m. — put in some laundry. read introvert power and start cooking a cabbage casserole while the laundry runs.5 p.m. — phone call with a friend. i don't have many friends, so i really treasure the friendships i do have. this particular friend has taught me so much about caring for myself and others and showing up for myself. i hope i have been a good friend to her as well over these years.7 p.m. — i'm not loving this casserole but i am not willing to cook anything else. maybe the leftovers will taste better? that's it, i'm sure the flavors just need to mix. i am not a good cook. read my book with the tv on in the background. it's too quiet around here.9 p.m. — nighty night.daily total: $21.73day two4 a.m. — up, prayers, push-ups.4:30 a.m. — out the door for the gym. we wear masks and there are only six people allowed at a time. i signed up for this time slot every day about two weeks ago. the regularity helps me. the one time there was a positive case, we shut down for two weeks. i feel safe making this decision to go to the gym.5:45 a.m. — back home to shower, take my meds, eat breakfast, and catch a bit of the news.7 a.m. — log in and get to work. i have a new role with a lot of responsibility and visibility which i am excited about but i'm definitely feeling imposter syndrome. i was supposed to be training for this role this year, but we've had people leave so i got promoted early.12 p.m. — have a salad for lunch. it's a working lunch.4:30 p.m. — log off. my eyes are hurting a bit from the screen time, but that doesn't stop me from wasting time on the internet! i heat up some cabbage leftovers. ""i think it tastes better,"" i lie to myself out loud. it's okay. no one can hear me.7:15 p.m. — i log in to an oa meeting. sometimes i have trouble focusing.8:30 p.m. — i read and then go to bed.daily total: $0day three4 a.m. — same morning routine as yesterday, and thankful for it!5:45 a.m. — tea, shower, and mentally get ready for the day.6:30 a.m. — read some of my emails before heading to work. i am already feeling stressed. why do we speak in acronyms? i honestly don't understand half of this email and will translate when i am at work. i pick up a breakfast sandwich on the way to work. $4.297 a.m. — luckily i beat the snowstorm to work. on the way to work, i listened to janelle monae. she should have a broadway show! i am right and do not care to hear any dissenting opinions! one of my favorite songs of hers is ""cold war."" i am so thankful for what music has done for me. for an introvert with depression, feeling seen is a real gift.7:30 a.m. — meeting marathon begins. i do not need to be in some of these meetings.11 a.m. — go into the lab to do science. i spent so long training to be a scientist and spend less and less time actually doing science. c'est la vie.1 p.m. — 20-minute break for lunch i brought from home — salad and yogurt. 20 minutes because that is the incubation time for this step in the experiment.4:30 p.m. — lab work is finished up just in time. i head to the food pantry to volunteer. i know it's bad to have favorites but i have some of my favorite clients today.7 p.m. — my shift is done. i head home and log into an oa meeting while i eat more cabbage! how is there still more cabbage?!?!8:30 p.m. — stay after the meeting to talk to another fellow. we used to see each other in person and this sucks, but i am incredibly glad we have kept this meeting going. we stay up way late for us.10 p.m. — send my food to my accountability partner and go to bed.daily total: $4.29day four4:30 a.m. —get up and get ready while listening to selena. i get to the gym and workout.5:45 a.m. — home and decide to roll out my muscles. then i shower and use some hair oil.6:45 a.m. — maybe this cabbage will taste better with a fried egg or two?7 a.m. — it kinda does! i listen to the news. it is really depressing. i turn it off. my brain is sad enough and the news can push me over the edge if i'm not taking care of myself.7:30 a.m. — type tap tippy tap type. work stuff.9 a.m. — a scientist co-worker is telling me they don't want to get the vaccine because they don't know what is in it and what the long-term effects are. this person also eats tons of processed foods. everyone has the right to their opinion, i just don't see how the lines are drawn. also, we work for a science company. one thing oa has taught me is that my way is not the only way and so much is out of my control. i move on from the conversation.1 p.m. — i feel heavy feelings setting in. my medication was really helpful in the beginning, but i am wondering if i need an adjustment.4 p.m. — log off and head to the grocery store. i see a woman with two kids physically strapped to her and another three walking beside the cart. i immediately feel overwhelmed even though this has nothing to do with me. i want a family, but it doesn't seem to be working in my favor right now. i am not in a relationship and online dating has been simply ridiculous. i get yogurt, almond milk, pistachios, cheese, and salad mix. $19.095 p.m. — the borough has said that i need all new fire alarms in the rental part of my house, so i purchase the fire alarm/co2 combo. i need three. the three-pack costs more than two two-packs, so i buy two two-packs. i spring for the ones with a 10-year battery so i don't have to revisit this for 10 years. i purchased this home because it would allow me to have additional rental income. it is not what i would have purchased as a first choice and it is not in the neighborhood i want to be in, but i think sacrificing a little now to have an additional income stream in the future will be worth it. $146.226 p.m. — i call my mortgage company to start the process of doing a streamline refinance. i did not put 20% down on my home, because, well, i did not have it. refinancing will lower my rate and get me some of my original interest back, saving about $200. i also got a fixer-upper and did a renovation loan, so after the renovations are done, i will do a full refinance to get rid of the premium i have to pay because i did not put 20% down. the streamline refinance requires no appraisal and very little paperwork on my end, so it seems like a good way to reduce costs with little effort. the full refinance would save about an additional $300. (meaning after rental income, i would only have about $400 or so to pay on my mortgage. when both units are rented out, the property will cash flow about $900 each month since my unit is larger.)6:30 p.m. — cook dinner and lunch for tomorrow. i make a veggie pot pie from a meal kit. it's tasting pretty bland so i add some five spice and hope for the best.7:30 p.m. — it's okay. i add some sour cream and now it is better. i wonder what the origin of sour cream is.7:45 p.m. — sour cream is thought to be a russian invention, originally made from horse's milk.8 p.m. — bedtime.daily total: $165.31day five4 a.m. — same thing!8 a.m. —i have a meeting with a co-worker that i don't love. it goes fine.10:15 — i am waiting at my doctor's office and am the only one in the waiting room, by their design. i see that i have a complaint about an item i sold on ebay. the buyer is upset that the order hasn't arrived yet. i know it hasn't because the tracking number i provided the buyer says the order hasn't arrived. when i open the message to start a reply, i see ebay has stepped in to remind the buyer to check the provided tracking number and that they were going to close the complaint and transfer the funds to my account once the tracking says the item arrived. thanks, ebay. while i am on the site, i list an old fitbit. i pay a copay. $2512:30 p.m. — back in the office. i do some work in the lab and then break for lunch. i eat my salad lunch and some bread from home.2:30 p.m. — the people nearby are talking about spiderman. loudly.3:30 p.m. — still? really??? i am in such a bad mood today. they are just enjoying each other's company and talking about a hobby. i really need a mood adjustment. i don't feel like me lately, and while yes, they could be quieter, i can have a reaction that serves me better.5:15 p.m. — head home and get a new prescription on the way. $106 p.m. — pick up a rotisserie chicken, bread, and mac and cheese from the grocery store. $13.536:30 p.m. — store mac and cheese is gross. it looked so good. i throw it away and feel some guilt because i am wasting food and money but also some pride in myself. in my binge days, i would have eaten the mac and cheese because i bought it and didn't care what i put in my body. the ability to walk away from things that don't benefit me is a muscle i'm developing in oa, and it's helping in so many aspects of life, including dating. yes, i believe men are like bad mac and cheese.7:30 p.m. — i sign some papers for the refinance. of the options i can select to fill out the ""manner in which title is held section,"" ""single woman"" is the most appropriate one i can select. i didn't know my gender expression had anything to do with my house title! learn some new bullshit every day.8 p.m. — i see i got charged for my meal kit delivery. it is 14 servings. i get the kit every other week to cut down on shipping materials. $65.678:30 p.m. — i see there is a new buy alert from the stock service i use. i buy the stock in my roth ira. i have the funds in a cash position in my roth ira already, so this doesn't cost me anything today.9 p.m. — lights out. that was a day.daily total: $114.20day six4:30 a.m. — oh megan, i wish i was on some hot girl shit but i'm not.5:45 a.m. — really enjoy my workout today. shower and breakfast.6:30 a.m. — take my laptop to my couch and read some work docs before another meeting marathon starting at 8 a.m.7:45 a.m. — check in with the rally app. we can get $200 each year from work from doing challenges on the app. most of them are pretty chill, so the real work is just selling my data!1 p.m. — take a break and eat a sandwich.1:30 p.m. — back on the old lappy top for work.3 p.m. — therapy session. my insurance company hasn't been billing me for virtual appointments. usually, this costs $25.4:10 p.m. — back online for work.5:30 p.m. — call with a tax professional. i am finding the rules around rentals and deductions quite confusing so i am interviewing a tax professional. i really like this one, to the top of the list they go.6:30 p.m. — turn off from work for the day. i have zero desire to cook and eat leftovers.7:30 p.m. — it's snowing, which means my meal kit might not arrive on time which sends me on a food spiral. i feel so exhausted i just sit on the couch and cry. i realize i haven't hugged anyone in over a month. my nose feels raw from crying. i don't watch anything on tv or read a book because i don't want to engage any of my emotions. i sit on the couch until i fall asleep.daily total: $0day seven6:30 a.m. — up. thankful for another day to get to try this all again. last night was bad.7 a.m. — workout. feel really strong today. i think i just needed to cry yesterday.8 a.m. — this is fun — turns out i don't actually need these smoke alarms. i have all that i need already for both my unit and the rental, so i return the four i bought earlier this week. i pick up some batteries to replace in the smoke alarms for my tenants.
